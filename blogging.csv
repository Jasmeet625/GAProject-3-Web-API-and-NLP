Yes… There are a number of services that provide free web hosting, but I would NOT recommend it to anyone who is planning a serious project.

Like many services on the internet that are *free* it is YOU that becomes the product. 

Understand that these free web hosting providers are not providing their services out of the kindness of their hearts. These companies need to and will turn a profit and they will engage in monetization tactics unbeknownst to the user in order to profit.

Instead, it's much better to pay for an affordable web hosting service like [Siteground](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/sskmfw/siteground_web_hosting_review_honest_thoughts/). That way you know exactly what you're getting upfront and you don't have to rely on the interests of a sketchy 3rd part to sustain your website.

As a general rule of thumb, here are the things you can expect to experience by using a free web hosting service.

###Advertisements
Expect to see permanent advertisements on your website and in the back-end control panel. Advertisements will appear not only for yourself but all of your users.

###Unreliable uptimes/slow web page load times
Self explanatory. If you’re using a free web hosting service, don’t expect to have blazing fast load times. 

###Lack of privacy.
Expect your data to be sold and shared to third parties.

###Lack of functionality
The functionality of what you can or cannot do with your website will be limited. For example, it is likely that you will not be able to use your own domain. Your website will probably be structured as a sub domain to the parent company. (IE: *mywebite.freehosting.com*)

##The only worthwhile free webhosting
The only form of free web hosting I recommend is Github pages. Github pages allows you to host a simple website using the code stored on your repository.

Github pages is perfect for developers looking to host a simple portfolio website as it does require developer knowledge in order to implement. If you're looking to build a WordPress website however, you cannot run WordPress on Github pages. Instead you'll need to find [WordPress web hosting provider](https://www.reddit.com/r/HostingHostel/comments/t0igc9/best_hosting_for_wordpress_sites_full_guide/).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m very interested in crypto and web3.0 and have been considering switching to a platform which offers cryptocurrency as the reward for my content - especially one that allows me to have control over the ownership. (For context, I&amp;#39;m thinking about blogs such as Minds, Mirror, Steemit etc.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you all think are the pros and cons of me moving to a blogging platform that pays in crypto? I&amp;#39;d love to hear others&amp;#39; experiences with these platforms before I decide if its worth exploring further or not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So I focus on interviewing folks from the Crypto field about the projects that they develop and work on. 

It's a Q&amp;A type deal where I try to get an origin/creator story out of them, having pretty good slow and steady success too.   
My issue is that I go through periods of drought where I run out of interviews to do but naturally  I still want to be able to produce content.   
I had 2 ideas, and I'd LOVE any feedback, please!

IDEA 1: Just write about related stuff. The subject matter, and name of the blog, is about Crypto/NFT/Decentralised tech-related, so perhaps I could explore projects on my own, write about the industry, news events, there is never-ending content there to write about. My perspective kind of thing.

IDEA 2: Interview folks from other industries, perhaps, related industries. I have a friend right now who just went full-time into video content creation (YouTube), I'd love to interview him for the blog. And I have a list of others that I have spoken to on Twitter and whatnot from other industries, I could literally rev the content engines back up immediately.

**""Does Google cap how much traffic a site can get overall, or is each piece of content handled individually? I’ve doubled the articles on my blog the last 8 months. New articles gained roughly the same clicks/impressions that the old articles have lost. Coincidence?""**

\----------------

I have one very old website (8+ years) that used to be massive (16k views a day).

Google kept fucking it with updates for years.

One year, I decided to ""revive the site"" and wrote 80 articles that to this day, I consider a master-piece. (Original research + good writing).

Most of the articles hit page 1. However, they provided zero boost to the overall traffic.

Meaning, they were getting me traffic, but the traffic was only compensating for the traffic lost from the old articles.

This guy also notices the same phenomenon.

If you think about it, this would be a GENIUS and yet EVIL move by Google encouraging people to write non-stop.

Ultimately, Google, just like YouTube, wants you to produce as much content as you humanly can. Thus, by putting a SHADOW cap on small sites, they put you in constant production mode.

You keep thinking, just 50 articles more...just 50 articles more....just 50 articles more....

\------------------

Another example would be Phil's site. He has 600+ articles but got hit by an update. Now he plans to write 300+ more posts to make up for it.

So, the new articles are meant to make up for the loss of traffic coming from old.

The next year, his site may be hit by another update (hopefully not) and the same problem will manifest.

The updates will keep the site from breaking the Google Shadow Cap.

88,,Blogging," Hi, I am the founder of a blog/e-commerce store and I am looking to scale my efforts with a very limited budget - $2000-$3000 roughly.

It's in the preparedness niche - a high-paying niche me and a friend are personally invested in. I receive anywhere from 15,000 to 30,000 visitors a month - it's somewhat seasonal. My social media following is around 20,000 - most on Facebook.

I don’t count the first year because it was 2020 in my market and we couldn’t advertise and it’s hard to build a network when you are quarantined. Instead, since we couldn’t cold call or advertise I took advantage of the time.

During quarantine I literally spent 13 hours a day, 7 days a week designing marketing materials for my business.

2021 came and I went through a divorce. What I discovered through the last two years is I LOVE the marketing side of real estate. I get excited about the brand materials, blogging, writing, designing my website, doing photo shoots, creating ideas and collaborating about brand sessions with my photographer. I have a design brain naturally and I'm always asked to design homes, fashion and home decor. My office recently went viral on TikTok and was blown up with comments about links to purchase items.

I am always complimented  on how great my social media posts are, how great my website looks, etc. I am told daily all the time that I should do design work. I get so much joy from designing and sharing on social media my tips and favorite items. But I am overwhelmed and clueless with how to implent this as my passion to make money?

How on earth do I blog? How do I take my talent and turn it into a career? I know I have a community and could have a following, but I am clueless where to start or what the options are? I feel like I'm leaving so much possibility and potential on the table.

Then my other question (imposter sysndrom, ha) is.. if i am so great at marketing, why hasn't my real estate career blown up? 

…Then again, branding is great but real estate is about building a network,and its been rough as a new agent…

I have the following question.

I am not a native English speaker. I want to start a blog about personal finance and stuff like that and now I'm not sure what to do. 

Should I write the articles in English or in my native language? 

  
Pros of native language: 

* well obviously it's my native language so I can structure and articulate very well and I know how to write grammatically correct sentences
* also the affiliate marketing is easier because there are things that are only usable in my country which I can refer to
* there is not that much competition in this space in my native language 

Pros of English language: 

* well, English is a world language. so obviously many many people would be a possible audience 
* this would be a chance to improve my English skills pretty much

November of 2019 was not a great time to start a travel blog. I didn't want to do top 10 posts, points/award travel, or travel gossip. I wanted to just do honest reviews and comparisons of regular travel. I travel for work so I get to see lots of somewhat mundane places.

&lt;p&gt;I got 0 hoplinks which is good (no proof it&amp;#39;s the product that sucks)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried finding articles with &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; intend but can&amp;#39;t seem to find any easy to rank. If i understand correctly i don&amp;#39;t need to target such keywords, as long as the keywords that i do target have a product that&amp;#39;s relevant and of interest to my audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if i want to promote a dating app and &amp;quot;best dating app for x&amp;quot; is very competitive, could i promote it in a &amp;quot;where to find women to date&amp;quot; article? i feel the user isn&amp;#39;t looking to sign up to an app for that query .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the following questions:
Can i promote multiple products on different articles? How do i promote them-mention them and say this will help you blah blah or do a full review on it? And is promoting Amazon products even worth it considering the low commission?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;care&amp;quot; for the money yet but it d be nice to see some money being made. I have about 75 articles and i post consistently every few days, so I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;done&amp;quot; trying to write as much content as i can if that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

152,,Blogging,"   I've recently been updating my website and have seen a noticeable downturn in my traffic. I'm quite new at 48 articles now and only about 6-7 months since starting the website, but in January I began to get one or two organic searches multiple days in a row. When I first started writing, I didn't really do any keyword research or SEO optimization and just wrote articles based on knowing my field and target audience.

   Encouraged by starting to get a small trickle of organic traffic, I thought it would be a good time to go back through my old posts and fix some formatting and optimize for a clear keyword or two in each.  Since I started this process though, my impressions, traffic, page ranking on Google and organic traffic have dipped steadily. I have been using Yoast SEO's suggestions to add in keywords here and there, but have largely left the content of the articles the same. 

   Does updating articles do any sort of ""reset"" on their aging? I know you need to gain some age and have a certain number of articles and backlinks for google to ""trust"" your website, but I thought updating would have a positive effect on that showing that it isn't a dead website and that the author is keeping information up to date. 

   Am I just failing to understand something about SEO or keywords? Do I just need to wait a bit and then I'll see a really big uptick as Google gets to know my improved articles? From what I understand, I'm in a very YMYL niche, so could that be something to do with it? 

   I was also planning on updating permalink structure from wordpress's basic format to one using the title to include keywords. I was going to do that after updating everything currently on the site, but now I'm worried that doing that will put me back even further.

Fortunately, we've compiled a list of the top 5 content planning tools we've discovered to assist you in improving your content marketing.

1. **Loomly** is a social media content management app that may help you track ideas, write, optimise, and preview articles, as well as schedule them all from within the app. You may also monitor the effectiveness of your social media material to see what works and what doesn't. You may also interact with users who interact with your social media material using Loomly.
2. **ContentCal** is a simple content planning tool that allows you to collaborate with all members of your team and grant specific approvals so that the correct people have access to the right information. Users can see their material with ContentCal because it is a mapping software, making it easier to grasp where you stand in terms of project completion. ContentCal uses the platform's own automatic posting and workflows to maintain photos, timetables, campaigns, and correspondence all in one place.
3. **Trello** is one of the most user-friendly content planning platforms. It employs a Kanban method of content planning, with cards that may be moved across boards as needed. Trello's comment and task management capabilities make collaboration a breeze. Trello boards may be used to organise a content schedule, plan a marketing campaign, create to-do lists, and brainstorm ideas, among other things. Trello also features a calendar view that makes spotting holes or repetitions in your content marketing strategy simple.
4. **Asana** is a project management app that also doubles as a content planner. Asana is a project management tool that allows teams and individuals to organise, track, and manage their content calendars. Asana is another drag-and-drop tool with a variety of views to help you visualise your content strategy in the way that works best for you.
5. **Wrike** is a content planning platform that focuses on specific content marketing strategies. It offers a simple design that allows you to organise your information using dropdowns, keep track of actionable items and tasks, and communicate with other team members via the message board.

I am wondering if anyone would be so kind to help me out. My name is Robert and I have been suffering with Long COVID for just a week shy of 2 years now. It’s truly devastated my life. I tell my story in a CBC News story and reddit post below:

[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/covid-19-long-hauler-hamilton-1.5948151](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/covid-19-long-hauler-hamilton-1.5948151)

I have kept a journal and have written some posts and stories of my experiences with long COVID but I want to be able to share my story with as many people as possible so that others do not feel so alone like I have.

I am a 39 year old once very healthy male – marathon runner, primary school teacher but have been left not able to work for nearly two years – it’s been horrible. I know that there are not many men who have come forward to share their story and I have been approached by Nick Guthe, the husband of Heidi Ferrer, former writer of Dawson’s Creek who committed suicide because of long COVID to share my story, particularly as there is an absence of young men who have come forward to share.

I purchased the domain [www.lifeofalonghauler.com](http://www.lifeofalonghauler.com/) with the intention on creating a blog but due to my condition especially the brain fog and difficulty in neurological functioning I just have found it impossible to set up a WordPress or other hosted blog to publish and share my story.

I think about it every day and really wish I could do so but this is really what is standing in my way.

If there is anyone out there that would be willing to help set up a blog for me where I can just focus on making posts, I would be so eternally grateful. It can be a very simple format or layout, I just for the life of me can’t figure out how to do it (even though I am pretty computer savy or I mean once was but hopefully again in the future).

Please do let me know if you would be willing to volunteer in helping set this up for me so I can share my story so that others especially young men with Long COVID don’t feel so alone, I would be so very thankful.

Thanks for taking the time to read.

The reason I say my blog is different (please let me explain) is because I know people here mostly start blogs, write articles and wait for them to rank and then increase the visitors, etc. and don't normally make any income in the first 6 months or even a year.

Now...my blog gets (and was getting for over a year before I found out about the possibiblity to get Ad income from it) around 60K/70K visits a month from social media traffic.

I only have a bunch of articles so far so it is NOT the articles that bring people in if that makes sense and it is my plan write many more and build the blog that way too by offering quality content but that's another story.

So I don't have a clue what I am doing basically and need some advice. I understand that to apply for better Ad revenue you need a number of visits per month that I think I have? Should I do that?

I am going to share what last month has been in Adsense because, as I say, I would think that with that many visitors, the $$ are really low and I don't really get what all the other stats mean (as much as I research :| )

As you can see in the title, I'm gifting my keyword credits.

&amp;#x200B;

**Context**

My Keywords Everywhere credits are expiring in a month. And I have thousands of them. And I asked the mods to share some with you.

So, if you want to get keyword ideas keep reading.

I will use Keywords Everywhere and KeywordFinder.io in this process to get keywords ideas.

I can't promise the number of keywords, volume, and ""quality"". I will use the information you send me and copy the data from these tools. So, this isn't custom keyword research.

I want to help as many people as possible, but I can't promise how many of you I can reply to. I estimate to be able to do this for 10-20 people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's what you can do**

DM me with:

* the topic of the website and be specific. You don't need to share the site name, only the topic. One example is ""drone photography"".

210,,Blogging,"Blogging is a wonderful way to gain popularity for yourself or your business. Blog writing is now an integral part of the culture and the popularity of some people. If you are interested in blog writing, the suggestions in this write-up will certainly educate you on what you need to do. Often add an article. Several blog owners will start by uploading as soon as a week or daily, and after that, fall short to continue the constant updates. Any initially interested visitors will certainly weary if they wait a long period between blog posts or updates to articles. You can attempt those functions to publish in your blog site at the very least as soon as a week and give e-mail updates. 

Compose new articles as often as possible. If you want to expand your readership, it is required to infuse fresh web content frequently and register user-specific domain names, such as if you like to target the Pakistani community you have to go with .Pk Domain name for better results. Once you have registered your domain and made a website, publish content regularly. If you do not regularly upgrade your blog, web customers will certainly not have any factor to revisit it. Blogging daily will dramatically enhance your web traffic. Pursue credibility in your article. 

Come off as a regular individual and also not as an unapproachable specialist. Instead, attempt to maintain a persona that is honest and clear. Always remember this. A blog can be an electrical outlet for your creativity and uniqueness. It would help if you strived to improve; however, do not make things perfect. If you are incorrect, then accept that every person makes blunders. You are one-of-a-kind, as well as nobody can replicate you. Make sure your messages are clear as well as concise. Although you should give visitors the details they are looking for, too much information can birthed them. 

Those that review blogs aren't most likely to appreciate a Shakespearian capability to define one of the most ordinary details of a setup. They desire you to get to the point.

231,,Blogging,"I've taken on a gig writing a couple of articles a month on a topic I'm not actually hugely familiar with and, in my opinion, the word limit is too short to actually do a decent job. I've also been told to potentially expect some editing before it's published.

As a beginner in the writing world I'm caught between wanting to write for money but also having my name attached to something that might bit reflect my true style or quality. I can't decide if it's better to have my name there so that I can show off my portfolio later down the line when looking for other gigs or to have a pseudonym so that my name/reputation and future prospects aren't potentially tarnished. 

This is all speculative of course as it may end up going up as it was written but I'm also suffering from a lack of confidence in my writing ability as it stands and am concerned my lack of familiarity might come across too. Plus having to squeeze a lot of content into a small amount of words will leave a disappointing article that doesn't show off my skills.

Lastly I'll add that I have some pretty big social phobias and I usually steer completely clear of any form of social media. I hate it and it leaves me feeling vulnerable and open to criticism and threat. I don't have a thick skin so maybe this isn't the best line of work for me.

But at the same time I've always said I would like to write and it seems a bad idea to not take it up now it's been offered to me.

Any thoughts?",t2_955jdvo7,False,,0,False,Should I initially write under a pseudonym when writing for others and under their rules?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Question'}]",r/Blogging,False,6,Question,0,,False,t3_sfs0vo,False,dark,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1643491252.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Blogging,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve taken on a gig writing a couple of articles a month on a topic I&amp;#39;m not actually hugely familiar with and, in my opinion, the word limit is too short to actually do a decent job. I&amp;#39;ve also been told to potentially expect some editing before it&amp;#39;s published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a beginner in the writing world I&amp;#39;m caught between wanting to write for money but also having my name attached to something that might bit reflect my true style or quality. I can&amp;#39;t decide if it&amp;#39;s better to have my name there so that I can show off my portfolio later down the line when looking for other gigs or to have a pseudonym so that my name/reputation and future prospects aren&amp;#39;t potentially tarnished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all speculative of course as it may end up going up as it was written but I&amp;#39;m also suffering from a lack of confidence in my writing ability as it stands and am concerned my lack of familiarity might come across too. Plus having to squeeze a lot of content into a small amount of words will leave a disappointing article that doesn&amp;#39;t show off my skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly I&amp;#39;ll add that I have some pretty big social phobias and I usually steer completely clear of any form of social media. I hate it and it leaves me feeling vulnerable and open to criticism and threat. I don&amp;#39;t have a thick skin so maybe this isn&amp;#39;t the best line of work for me.

So, my WordPress dashboard was crashing and I started to find the reason behind it, and then on some videos, they were showing that deactivated and active the plugins and then it would resolve the issue but I tried and then also didn't work out.

Because I knew somewhere that this was not the problem and tried re-installing the WordPress site. And, on the Softaculous App installer, there was showing a site is already existed so I removed that and re-installed it and when I got into the dashboard it was completely new. And, I knew and that's why I had already taken the updraft backup.

So, when I got to add the plugin and link with my google drive and look for the backups which I restore it wasn't just there and I was so shocked and then rescan it a few times and no results.

But when I had my site and I took the backup it was in the existing backups but in the new site in the same google id, it's just not there.

So, my WordPress dashboard was crashing and I started to find the reason behind it, and then on some videos, they were showing that deactivated and active the plugins and then it would resolve the issue but I tried and then also didn&amp;#39;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I knew somewhere that this was not the problem and tried re-installing the WordPress site. And, on the Softaculous App installer, there was showing a site is already existed so I removed that and re-installed it and when I got into the dashboard it was completely new. And, I knew and that&amp;#39;s why I had already taken the updraft backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when I got to add the plugin and link with my google drive and look for the backups which I restore it wasn&amp;#39;t just there and I was so shocked and then rescan it a few times and no results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I had my site and I took the backup it was in the existing backups but in the new site in the same google id, it&amp;#39;s just not there. And, that&amp;#39;s why first I took a zip backup of the wp-content but now I am not able to restore it.

259,,Blogging,"Hi all, 

   I've been writing articles for almost 6 months now and am up to about 40 posts.  I feel like I'm getting the hang of it now, but I know most of my articles have a ton of SEO issues and I'm not getting almost any organic traffic.

   I'm wanting to go back through all of my posts mindfully updating them for quality, SEO, and aesthetics before I get too overwhelmed. I wondered if anyone had a checklist of things to keep in mind or change as I go through? I want to try to do as many important changes all at once rather than do one and then have to comb back through them all to make further changes.

 Here are the things I have currently listed that I want to fix up, but would appreciate any other suggestions that I should add to my list to improve:

&amp;#x200B;

1: Writing Quality

2: More research studies

   Both of these should increase  my text length, but word count is another thing I'm trying to increase as well as I've heard longer tends to rank higher. 

3: Use mindful keyword and do all the other Yoast SEO suggestions to make it green.

4: Update URL to have keyword included (I just used the basic ones wordpress gives, which apparently isn't good)

5: Add a meta description and excerpt

6: New titles using keyword

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any other things that I'm missing that a beginner might have missed when just starting out? Also, I have some more time sensitive news content and then evergreen content, should I only focus on the evergreen content or try to optimize all articles? 

I've also been trying to do some backlinking on Reddit and such to get myself out there and be helpful in the community, but will updating my urls kill all of that backlinking efforts? I also post all my articles on several social media platforms, and wouldn't want to kill off all of those posts. I've heard that I can use something called redirect links, but just a bit worried.

**Background:** I enjoy researching various topics and research papers for school/college have always been easy A's because I throughly enjoy it. And written some technical manual stuff for my previous job, it was meh, but do-able. So I started doing things like social media posts, some threads, longer comments/posts to try out regularly doing it on my terms. It's given me enough experience/confidence boost to want to do it in a more centralized and consistent way. My goal with it is to share helpful informative topics in a more personal/laymen way with appropriate sourcing linked. Don't necessarily want to earn a living, but if there a helpful tools I end up using/paying for, I'd like to earn enough to break even at least. Cannot invest much currently. 

**Issues my brain keeps getting stuck on:**

-Is starting on something like Pateron, Ko-fi, Tumblr worth it while I figure out a website(other site suggestions welcomed)? Is your own website necessary? Or more of a preference thing? 

-How do you set your consistent deadlines? More of, what goes into figuring it out for you? 1 long and 5 short articles spread out? 1 article a week? 

-what helps(like habits, reminders, etc)keep your consistent deadlines being met? Especially if you hit writer's block, life comes up, etc


-When starting outside of making/putting  content out regularly, what is the first thing(s) you should start working on? Like promoting, tags, key words, adding images 

-is there community etiquette I should be aware of? Example: Content creating in general, you don't ask for free work or in exchange for ""exposure."" Are there groups/plateforms/online spaces for networking/just talking with other bloggers you recommend?

But I feel like I have enough information to start, just not how to actually execute it all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; I enjoy researching various topics and research papers for school/college have always been easy A&amp;#39;s because I throughly enjoy it. And written some technical manual stuff for my previous job, it was meh, but do-able. So I started doing things like social media posts, some threads, longer comments/posts to try out regularly doing it on my terms. It&amp;#39;s given me enough experience/confidence boost to want to do it in a more centralized and consistent way. My goal with it is to share helpful informative topics in a more personal/laymen way with appropriate sourcing linked. Don&amp;#39;t necessarily want to earn a living, but if there a helpful tools I end up using/paying for, I&amp;#39;d like to earn enough to break even at least. Cannot invest much currently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been 8 months since I’ve published anything or paid any attention to it at all but I still get monthly Google reports. Last month I had around 250 clicks and 5.5k impressions.

&lt;p&gt;Can’t I delete whole posts and rewrite them then publish them with the same web address or does that affect Google ranking? &lt;/p&gt;

Our current plan has been to wait till we can get 50,000 sessions/month on Google Analytics so we can sign up with Mediavine. While we're optimistic that will happen in 2022, we're not certain, and I'm wondering if we should sign up with a smaller network in the interim.

But I've been getting the same traffic for months now, even after publishing more articles which have low or no competition at all, i still don't see much change.

It seems like Google has restricted me to around 600 visitors a month and no matter how much i upload I can't get past that. My traffic is 20 one day, 25 the next, back to 18 then 26 etc.

Along my best performing articles is one that i published very early on about 8 months ago, then another in my top 10 is one i published couple weeks ago in December. I uploaded 8 articles in december so far, 2-3 bring some traffic and the rest-even thought there's no competition and they're high volume- don't bring or maybe one visitors or two.

Overall my traffic is going up but very very slowly looking back to dec 2020 when i started. I was going up til july of 2020 then a huge drop but haven't really recovered since then. My peak was 35 visitors a day in july and now I'm averaging 25. I've yet to reach 30 since july and 20 or so articles later

I know a lot of bloggers defend that blogging isn't dying (which i'm 50/50 on the whole debate), however we can't deny that the increase of other platforms (podcasting, youtube etc) has caused an impact on the blogging space. In my opinion, there seems to be less and less and less successful blogs arising or already established blogs sustaining themselves.

**A couple of lines about my blog**

I have started a blog about astronomy and so far I have published 6 articles. I write quite slowly since English is not my native language, but I have an editor to proofread it. On average I can probably write 2 solid articles per week. I do not have an astronomy-related degree, but it has been my hobby since forever and I am not afraid to get my hands dirty on researching the topic.

**Issues**

In my understanding, one has to publish around 50 articles before Google gets a firm grip on what your blog is and starts throwing it more in search results, but I just want to check if I picked the wrong niche before I get back to work. It is hard to find a topic that is interesting enough and that I could rank for it. I just went through 60+ topic ideas and the results were all flooded with articles from high authority sites like space dot com, NASA site, or Wikipedia. Sure, I can find a moon with zero articles about it, but that will be just a small gray rock with nothing to it.

There is not a lot of room for creative solutions. I can write an article specifically about moon Io’s atmosphere, but that won’t put it above Io articles from all these big sites, because there is only so much you can write about Io, and they will cover the atmosphere part as well. Related searches often suggest things like “Is Io the moon of Jupiter” or “Io moon facts”.

Similar problem with SEO. It feels pointless to check for keywords since the options are usually limited and I will end up with the same or similar article and h2 tags either way. But it may be that I just suck at SEO because I wanted to focus on writing and finally start publishing.

**Should I:**

1. Keep writing solid content on whatever topic I will with moderate SEO usage.

2. Try to find less competitive topics/keywords. Although I don’t think I can find a lot of those.

3. Niche down.

4. Quit blogging.

I realized that I may be on the path to wasting a couple of months of my time and I just want to see if I can change the odds in my favor or just come to terms with defeat. It’s a really long post, but I am going crazy and the truth would release me, in one or another way.

I wrote a blog, made the site look pretty, installed some plugins after studying them really well like google analytics, a powered by WordPress remover plugin etc.

All this took weeks since it was my first time. And all of sudden the following happened.

I spoke with the company with whom I purchased both Domain and Hosting.

Initially I couldn't login to both WordPress's WP-Admin ( was displaying a screen without the Login)

and somehow my Cpanel got suspended by the hosting company. The reason they gave is "" suspended due to Phishing ""

My mind was blank, i had no idea what was going on.

After  a lot of discussion they said "" Okay, we are ready to unblock your hosting account and website if you delete the reported content immediately ""

After further discussion I came to know that they wanted me to delete some files after they've unblocked it.

They said they wanted me to delete the reported content( I was confused as to who reported when). I asked them what reported content.

They said "" The reported content is storing exactly by the links "". He gave me those links. He said those links were marked as Phishing.

They later said "" If you confirm that you will delete the content from there immediately, we're ready to unsuspend your services.  ""

I said ""   content is stored in the domain root folder of the website -&gt; subfolder with names ""panel""

So basically i had to delete the index file from the Panel folder.

After much discussion we came to know that I had to delete the index .php file after renaming the panel folder.

Later They even asked me to delete the Panel folder.

After this process they did a restore of  the website to a previous date. Everything was working with same password . But I lost a lot of customization with the restore even though I only wrote one blog.

I somehow felt its all ok now and delayed changing the password of the WordPress site. A week later today my ""WordPress"" site got hacked.

The company said that it was hacked and they have the same problem with all the restores, and there was no way they can restore it back.

1. If it's so easy to beat Quora, why is Quora still in the top page when a query has been answered by multiple blogs right underneath? And why does my own blog come 3rd in the results when there are better higher doman sites answering the same question?

2. When I'm researching a query such as ""why do girls like bad boys"", I've noticed some blogs say things like ""she has daddy issues"" or ""women seek instant gratification"". I tend to use a softer approach when I'm answering such questions and say things like ""women have different preferences and some like bad boys"", i basically try to avoid being offensive.  Which of the two tactics works best and does it matter for rankings?

3. If I'm answering a long tail keyword, should i include questions from ""people also search for"" for the different headlines in my article or focus on answering the main query? For example if main keyword is ""why did she dump me"" and people also ask ""will a woman regret dumping me"", should i answer both questions or are these two seperate articles?

5. When creating a title for a long tail keyword article, should i make the title exactly what the question is? Since long tail keywords are long I don't have room for ""fluff"" like ""...10 ways to find out"" etc. or should i rephrase the title and add the fluff? What's better for clicks?

6. Start each section within the article with H1 or H2 heading? And can I go from H2 to H4 for the subsections if i think H3 is too big of a font?

403,,Blogging,"I have a website that I've ran since 2012, that was originally hosted on wordpress.com

Around 2017 is when I decided I wanted to become more serious and actually push more traffic to the website. 

I didn't really know where to start, so I decided to test out Pinterest and see whether I'd get any results with the medium.

I spent a good amount of time photoshopping images, making sure they're high quality, writing captions. All the bells and whistles.

And it was working!

I was getting a pretty good amount of traffic from the platform. It started with 600 visits per month, to 10,000 and at one point it was at 30,000 monthly visitors from Pinterest alone.

That's about the time when I decided to switch to a proper server where I'd hold my website and all.

And I continued pursuing Pinterest as a valiid venue of traffic generation.

At one point I was getting 20,000 active visitors per day.

And here comes 2018 where they started playing around with their algorythms. My traffic dropped from those highs to acceptable mediums. Nothing too scary, I was still getting traffic and everything was fine.

2020 is where Pinterest really just fucked up, in my opinion.

I noticed that a lot of people were complaining that their traffic had dropped as well. So, I decided to reach out to them thinking that they are going to respond.

For reference, at this point I had about 150 thousand followers (which I am confused why they have a follow system if it means nothing to your success on the platform) and I was getting about 35 thousand monthly views from Pinterest.

The drop was significant (we're talking 70-80%). Now I was getting only 2k views from Pinterest.

I reached out to them to see whether I've been shadow banned or something.

Their response is that Pinterest traffic was seasonal and that's the reason why there are fluctuations in traffic throughout the month.

Here's the problem. Seasonality, works as a valid explanation to some degree. It's normal to see seasonal changes in traffic depending on your niche. But it becomes a problem when LITERALLY EVERY PERSON on the Internet was experiencing the same problem as me at the exact same time. From hundreds of different niches.

Does seasonality cover every single niche?

Of course not. Also, my topic coverage on Pinterest is wide, covering a wider variety of topics that should create an equilibrium with my results. This was an obvious change that they were not disclosing with their content creators.

So I continued pushing and they told me that it could be because of their new algorythm that favors ""fresh content"".

I cannot tell you how much I hate that argument of ""fresh content"", because now they use it for everything as an excuse.

Anyway, I started creating ""fresh content"" and the resuslts were abismal. The 180 thousand followers that I had were literally useless. And I went from 2m monthly impressions to about 100k (from old pins that were still getting some sort of traffic).

So I gave up on Pinterest altogether. There was no point. It felt like a waste of time and frankly it was. What's the point in putting effort in creating content for the platform when you get nothing in return? Might as well funnel that energy and effort into another platform, where you'd get better results.

In my stats:

There was a jump in traffic around March of 2021. And why do you think that was the case? Pinterest of course.

Without doing ANYTHING for about 6 months, my Pinterest traffic went from 1.5k to 11k. And then to 31,000. So naturally I started putting more time and effort into Pinterest again. 

And this brings me to December of this year. Traffic and impressions are dropping again.

I've reached out to them again, just for the shits and giggles to see whether they've give me their ""seasonality"" answer to please my cynical mind. I haven't heard back from them yet, but what I wanted to say with this post is:

**DO NOT waste your time with Pinterest.**

Focus on other venus of traffic growth. Pinterest is too volatile and they're terrible at keeping up with their users. They do not communicate any changes or give you any straight answers.

They are trying to switch to a more AD-friendly platform and it's obvious as night and day.

They'll give you the seasonality argument just so they can keep you at ease, when in reality they're trying to destroy organic traffic so that if you want to tap into Pinterest's active community, you'd have to spend money to do so.",t2_3pp0xotm,False,,0,False,"Pinterest used to be great for traffic, now it's not worth your time","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Tips/Info'}]",r/Blogging,False,6,Tipsinfo,0,,False,t3_rd6nmn,False,dark,0.95,,public,48,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Tips/Info,False,48,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1639135727.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Blogging,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a website that I&amp;#39;ve ran since 2012, that was originally hosted on wordpress.com&lt;/p&gt;

412,,Blogging,"Hello everyone, unfortunately after the November Google Core Update my blog in the health niche has been hit hard (down up to 40%). Most SEO's are saying this Core Update was just general improvements to the algorithm and wasn't targeting anything in particular. These facts have caused me to look at my old blog posts from the last couple of years and think about how they can be improved, updated, and historically optimized. 

What are your best tips on updating your posts (1-2 years old) and keeping them fresh? A few months ago I began historically optimizing my top 10 posts anyways. For me, this meant going back through old posts on Google Search Console and seeing what other keyword variations I was ranking for in the top ten. I would then add these new keyword variations a few times into a 500ish word update of my post or while touching on a new angle/part for the old post. 

I thought this would help the freshness factor of these posts in Google's eyes, however, I saw little to no results. Additionally, after the newest Core Update, I've seen a big drop in rankings. 

Any suggestions on other ways to update posts? What should I go back and look for if I'm losing rankings fast in Google? It's been tough to figure out my problems since IMO my content is of high quality and there wasn't really a specific ""target"" to this Google Core Update.

Like, do I talk about my diet? Do I talk about the things that I’ve learned? Do I just talk about each individual session? And what about any longer posts that I decide to write every so often?

I don’t know. What do you guys think?

I've been meaning to start a food blog for a long time now. I've slowly and steadily been trying to learn about domains, hosting...So on and so forth. This has been an exciting BUT tiring journey because I come from a completely unrelated field so I basically started out with zero knowledge. The thought of blogging is something that excites me and I would love to some day be able to leave my job as a lawyer and earn from blogging... If possible :)

Now, I've finally come down to designing my website and... It's exhausting. I don't want to sound negative at all but I'm all over the place when it comes to this. I tried learning Gutenberg but there was so much that was unclear and could go wrong... Things weren't working the right way sometimes and that was just giving me so much anxiety and the same thing happened when I tried using Elementor. It was a tiny bit easier than Gutenberg but I was in a massive muddle all the time and just super confused. I don't know how to put it in words. 

I just want to come home after a long day of work and start writing recipes online while relaxing because I love writing and cooking. But I'm just not able to get to that point because I'm not able to get past the point of creating a website!

So then, I came across people talking about Premium Themes. I've been doing research on this and just wanted some input from people who definitely are better at all this than I am :) I would just like to know...

\- Are Premium Themes a good idea? I've been reading a lot about this and am hearing mixed opinions so I'd love to know what you are using, especially if you are a food blogger or personally know a food blogger. You can answer if you're not a food blogger too. Should I go for a Premium Theme or should I stick to working on making my Elementor skills better and create a website on my own somehow?

\- If you do use a Premium Theme, which one do you use and would you suggest it? Or is there another one you would suggest?

\- What do I need to look out for while purchasing a Premium Theme and is it true some plug-ins may break the theme? Because I'd love to download some SEO and security plug-ins and it'll be so scary if I don't know what will break the theme and mess it up.

Food bloggers and non-food bloggers are open to answer this question. Please share your experiences with me. I would love to get as much knowledge and information as possible. I'll be so grateful. I apologize if some questions are silly. Once again, this isn't my field or forte at all... But I'm trying super hard to understand it!

I've been working on a desktop app for creating text-heavy static websites. It's still a little rough around the edges. You can create pages, containing text and images, preview the site locally and then upload it for static hosting. It currently only supports [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com) for (free) hosting. But it also dumps the generated files (html, css) to your disk. So you can manually upload them to your preferred hosting service. You don't need an account, it works completely offline (except the upload of course). Your website (all text, images, settings etc.) is stored in a single file on your machine. You can sync that file across your devices via iCloud, gDrive or Dropbox as you please. Oh, and it's free.

456,,Blogging,"Almost every week I see someone ask what platform they should use for blogging.

And the most common answer they get is wrong.

That answer is WordPress.

This text is based on my experience and things I wish I knew when starting.

&amp;#x200B;

## Summary (TL;DR)

* I don't hate WordPress. But WP is a waste of resources for blogging.
* WP will cost more than you think at first
* There are easier platforms that do the same job well
* The learning curve is huge
* In most cases you have to use some coding skills
* There are valid reasons for using WP: (1) you want to learn how to make websites, (2) money is not a problem, (3) you want a lot of customization.

&amp;#x200B;

## Context

If you don't know let me give a quick context on WordPress.

Before WP, it wasn't easy for regular people to create, write and manage a blog. And you always had to code a lot for having a website.

So, WordPress was revolutionary when it came out. And it made creating website so much easier.

Especially, the dashboard made managing the content and aspect of the website easier.

Plus, the strongest point of WordPress is that you can **create almost everything** on it. It's like a blank canvas to start a website.

And also, plugins make WordPress more attractive by allowing people to achieve more with less coding.

So, it's natural that 42% of all websites in the world use WordPress. Making it by far the most popular CMS.

And companies of all sizes and sectors use it.

So, why you should avoid WordPress? That's what comes next.

&amp;#x200B;

## Why you shouldn't use WordPress

## Things have evolved

Did you read the part **where I said WordPress made managing websites easier and required less coding**? Well... Things have changed.

In the same way, WordPress made creating a website easier, other tools made creating a website even easier!

That's called progress.

WordPress will still be easier and faster than coding a website yourself.

But it's not efficient anymore.

You can create a blog in 2 minutes with blogstatic. Or, Use Ghost and Substack to send your posts by email with 0 coding required.

Yes, WordPress can do all things, but it requires more time and knowledge.

So, by using other tools, you can achieve at least 90% of the results with a fraction of the work, knowledge, and money.

&amp;#x200B;

## WordPress will cost more than you think

WordPress is open-source, and you don't have to pay to use it.

However, you need to pay to host it on a server to have the website online. And this easily costs more than $80 per year.

Plus, you have to consider that you'll use plugins to extend the functionality (or add things that should be there in the first place, depending on how you look at it).

And this includes plugins for SEO, website speed, and performance.

But the list can keep going for other plugins if you want more advanced stuff. I'm talking about pop-up/ opt-in plugins, contact forms, or memberships, just to name a few.

Also, you will almost certainly use a page builder (i.e., Elementor) or premium theme (i.e., GeneratePress or Astra). And that's another $50/60 per year right here.

Some quick math on this:

* Cheap shared hosting: $80/ year;
* Performance plugin: $50/ year;
* Theme/ Page builder: $50/ year;

&amp;#x200B;

That's $180 even if you don't use advanced stuff or an SEO plugin.

And people will push you to spend more on plugins than you really need. But that's a story for another day.

So, **the argument that WordPress is free isn't a valid motive for using it**.

&amp;#x200B;

## The learning curve is huge

Do you want to see how daunting it is to start using WordPress? I'm going to give 2 examples.

Do a search on YouTube for ""WordPress for beginners"".

Most videos are longer than 20 minutes, and there are a lot of 1 to 2 hours videos. And this is WordPress for beginners. When you go deeper on learning 1 theme or looking for niche stuff, the tendency is the same.

And let me tell you that even if you find a video named ""How To Build A Website in 20 Minutes"" that's a big lie.

Sure, someone can make a website in 20 minutes using Elementor by using saved presets and page layouts. But a beginner won't.

A beginner will need hours to learn how to use a page builder. Even if that's 2 hours, that's 6 times more than a video like that states.

Next, you might look for ""best theme for WordPress"" on Google.

Do you know what you'll find? I'll tell you. Extensive freaking lists of themes that don't mean shit.

Examples:

* 29 Best WordPress Multipurpose Themes
* 42 (Most Popular) Best WordPress Themes 2021
* Top 23 Most Popular WordPress Themes 2021
* 11 Fastest WordPress Themes Ranked
* 17 Best WordPress Themes 2021

What the hell!? How does this help a beginner?

Most of these articles are filled with affiliate links and give a brief summary of the theme. And they do it without even showing images of how it looks.

How will a beginner decide if they should pick GeneratePress, Astra, OceanWP, Avada, Neve, or Divi?

I know how the answer. They will watch videos on YouTube of these comparisons. Which will take countless hours!

And those articles and reviews tend to push the themes that pay the largest affiliate commissions without giving too much substance to the theme. Divi is an example of that.

The code of the Divi page builder isn't good. And it will make a dent in your website performance. I used Divi in the past, and the performance of the websites was awful.

If it sounds like I'm being too critical of WordPress? It is because I've been through this process, and it was a nightmare to create a blog.

It was a mistake I would like to avoid.

You're free to make the same mistakes or learn from this story.

&amp;#x200B;

## Avoid it if you don't want to code

At some point, you will need to add code to your WordPress website.

A typical example is redirecting your domain's HTTP (non-encrypted) version to the HTTPS (encrypted) version.

And the easier solution will be to read an article and grab the code. But **pasting code to your website without understanding it is very, very dangerous**.

This is why I say that you will have to be willing to learn some code. At the bare minimum, you have to have a deep look to understand what the code does.

And to learn that, you have to do research until you're sure that the code isn't malicious.

That's more time and complication with WordPress.

Another example of code you will probably need is CSS to style something on your website that looks bad.

So, if you don't want to touch code, avoid WordPress. But, sooner or later, you will have to do something with code in WordPress.

&amp;#x200B;

## Addressing counter arguments

## ""WordPress is superior because you can do almost everything with it""

That's the same thing as saying that a blank canvas is good because you can draw the Mona Lisa on it.

Not everyone has the skill or time to learn WordPress to enjoy all its features.

Also, learning to code isn't something that interests most bloggers.

## ""WordPress is free and cheap because you can self-host it""

Yes, WordPress is open-source, and you don't need to pay for it.

However, you need to pay for a server to host your WordPress website. And it will cost around $80 per year for shared hosting.

So, having a WordPress website won't be free unless you know how to turn it into a static website and host it on Github Pages or other similar options.

And on top of that, you will end up paying for plugins. Be it for SEO, pop forms, memberships, website optimization, or other areas.

Also, a good theme for WordPress will cost around $60 per year.

So, we are quickly talking about north of $200 per year in this stuff.

Cost break down:

* Cheap shared hosting: $80/ year (they hide this cost with the initial discount phase);
* Theme: $60/ year;
* Speed optimization: $50/ per year;
* SEO plugin: $50/ per year;
* Total= $240/ year.

&amp;#x200B;

## ""But you don't need to pay for plugins""

Yes, you don't.

Instead, you can code stuff yourself or have a website that's messy in terms of performance and SEO.

&amp;#x200B;

## ""You can pay someone to create the website for you""

Again this is throwing money at the problem created by WordPress in the first place.

You don't have to throw $200, $500, or $1k to have someone create a blog for you with other alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

## ""The community is huge and will help you with any problem you have""

True. But why sign up for WordPress problems in the first place?

For example, if I could go back, I wouldn't fight to make a contact form work on WordPress!

I'll just embed a form from a 3rd party company and use automation tools to email me when there is a new submission.

That's just one example where I spent more than 5 hours figuring out how to do something on WordPress.

&amp;#x200B;

## ""More than 40% of all websites use WordPress, so it must be good""

WordPress is a mature platform and more flexible than most competitors. And you can achieve a lot with it.

But do you need all this complexity for a blog? My answer is no.

With other tools, you can do 90% of the job with 5% of the work.

And to go after that extra 10%, you can move your blog to WordPress after you're profitable and have money to throw at WordPress problems.

Or if you are happy and don't need all the things WordPress allows, don't use it at all.

&amp;#x200B;

## ""The code of website builders is bad and bloated""

Many people use WordPress with page builders like Elementor or Divi, which can make the performance worse than a website builder.

Also, website builders are better than their reputation says.

Yet, it won't be better than a perfectly optimized static website, but neither is WordPress.

&amp;#x200B;

## Final Considerations

I had 2 painful experiences with WordPress when building personal blogs and won't recommend it to beginners or bloggers.

My biggest frustration isn't against the WordPress platform, but the WordPress community that profits from beginners without giving them proper context.

The recommendation flywheel and people profiting millions from new WordPress users is wrong.

WordPress isn't the be-all and best solution in the market by a long shot. But, if it was, there wouldn't be so many alternatives building on their inefficiencies.

So, my take is to use WordPress if you want to learn how to create websites, enjoy lots of customizations, and money isn't a problem.

For the rest of the blogger world, pick a better and less frustrating alternative.",t2_bvosa4oz,False,,0,False,"If you have to ask, avoid WordPress for blogging","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Tips/Info'}]",r/Blogging,False,6,Tipsinfo,0,,False,t3_r3ak0q,False,dark,0.39,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Tips/Info,False,0,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1638007528.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Blogging,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost every week I see someone ask what platform they should use for blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary (TL;DR)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t hate WordPress. But WP is a waste of resources for blogging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WP will cost more than you think at first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are easier platforms that do the same job well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The learning curve is huge&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t know let me give a quick context on WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, you have to consider that you&amp;#39;ll use plugins to extend the functionality (or add things that should be there in the first place, depending on how you look at it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this includes plugins for SEO, website speed, and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the list can keep going for other plugins if you want more advanced stuff. I&amp;#39;m talking about pop-up/ opt-in plugins, contact forms, or memberships, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you will almost certainly use a page builder (i.e., Elementor) or premium theme (i.e., GeneratePress or Astra). And that&amp;#39;s another $50/60 per year right here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some quick math on this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheap shared hosting: $80/ year;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance plugin: $50/ year;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theme/ Page builder: $50/ year;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s $180 even if you don&amp;#39;t use advanced stuff or an SEO plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And people will push you to spend more on plugins than you really need. But that&amp;#39;s a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;the argument that WordPress is free isn&amp;#39;t a valid motive for using it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The learning curve is huge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to see how daunting it is to start using WordPress? I&amp;#39;m going to give 2 examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do a search on YouTube for &amp;quot;WordPress for beginners&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most videos are longer than 20 minutes, and there are a lot of 1 to 2 hours videos. And this is WordPress for beginners. When you go deeper on learning 1 theme or looking for niche stuff, the tendency is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me tell you that even if you find a video named &amp;quot;How To Build A Website in 20 Minutes&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s a big lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, someone can make a website in 20 minutes using Elementor by using saved presets and page layouts. But a beginner won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beginner will need hours to learn how to use a page builder. Even if that&amp;#39;s 2 hours, that&amp;#39;s 6 times more than a video like that states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you might look for &amp;quot;best theme for WordPress&amp;quot; on Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know what you&amp;#39;ll find? I&amp;#39;ll tell you. Extensive freaking lists of themes that don&amp;#39;t mean shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29 Best WordPress Multipurpose Themes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;42 (Most Popular) Best WordPress Themes 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top 23 Most Popular WordPress Themes 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11 Fastest WordPress Themes Ranked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17 Best WordPress Themes 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the hell!? How does this help a beginner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these articles are filled with affiliate links and give a brief summary of the theme. And they do it without even showing images of how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will a beginner decide if they should pick GeneratePress, Astra, OceanWP, Avada, Neve, or Divi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know how the answer. They will watch videos on YouTube of these comparisons. Which will take countless hours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those articles and reviews tend to push the themes that pay the largest affiliate commissions without giving too much substance to the theme. Divi is an example of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code of the Divi page builder isn&amp;#39;t good. And it will make a dent in your website performance. I used Divi in the past, and the performance of the websites was awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it sounds like I&amp;#39;m being too critical of WordPress? It is because I&amp;#39;ve been through this process, and it was a nightmare to create a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a mistake I would like to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re free to make the same mistakes or learn from this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Avoid it if you don&amp;#39;t want to code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, you will need to add code to your WordPress website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical example is redirecting your domain&amp;#39;s HTTP (non-encrypted) version to the HTTPS (encrypted) version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the easier solution will be to read an article and grab the code. But &lt;strong&gt;pasting code to your website without understanding it is very, very dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I say that you will have to be willing to learn some code. At the bare minimum, you have to have a deep look to understand what the code does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to learn that, you have to do research until you&amp;#39;re sure that the code isn&amp;#39;t malicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s more time and complication with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of code you will probably need is CSS to style something on your website that looks bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you don&amp;#39;t want to touch code, avoid WordPress. But, sooner or later, you will have to do something with code in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Addressing counter arguments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;WordPress is superior because you can do almost everything with it&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the same thing as saying that a blank canvas is good because you can draw the Mona Lisa on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has the skill or time to learn WordPress to enjoy all its features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, learning to code isn&amp;#39;t something that interests most bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;WordPress is free and cheap because you can self-host it&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, WordPress is open-source, and you don&amp;#39;t need to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you need to pay for a server to host your WordPress website. And it will cost around $80 per year for shared hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, having a WordPress website won&amp;#39;t be free unless you know how to turn it into a static website and host it on Github Pages or other similar options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on top of that, you will end up paying for plugins. Be it for SEO, pop forms, memberships, website optimization, or other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a good theme for WordPress will cost around $60 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we are quickly talking about north of $200 per year in this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost break down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheap shared hosting: $80/ year (they hide this cost with the initial discount phase);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theme: $60/ year;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed optimization: $50/ per year;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SEO plugin: $50/ per year;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total= $240/ year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;But you don&amp;#39;t need to pay for plugins&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you can code stuff yourself or have a website that&amp;#39;s messy in terms of performance and SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;You can pay someone to create the website for you&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again this is throwing money at the problem created by WordPress in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to throw $200, $500, or $1k to have someone create a blog for you with other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;The community is huge and will help you with any problem you have&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True. But why sign up for WordPress problems in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if I could go back, I wouldn&amp;#39;t fight to make a contact form work on WordPress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll just embed a form from a 3rd party company and use automation tools to email me when there is a new submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just one example where I spent more than 5 hours figuring out how to do something on WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;More than 40% of all websites use WordPress, so it must be good&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordPress is a mature platform and more flexible than most competitors. And you can achieve a lot with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do you need all this complexity for a blog? My answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With other tools, you can do 90% of the job with 5% of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to go after that extra 10%, you can move your blog to WordPress after you&amp;#39;re profitable and have money to throw at WordPress problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if you are happy and don&amp;#39;t need all the things WordPress allows, don&amp;#39;t use it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;The code of website builders is bad and bloated&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people use WordPress with page builders like Elementor or Divi, which can make the performance worse than a website builder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, website builders are better than their reputation says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, it won&amp;#39;t be better than a perfectly optimized static website, but neither is WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Final Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had 2 painful experiences with WordPress when building personal blogs and won&amp;#39;t recommend it to beginners or bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest frustration isn&amp;#39;t against the WordPress platform, but the WordPress community that profits from beginners without giving them proper context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendation flywheel and people profiting millions from new WordPress users is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordPress isn&amp;#39;t the be-all and best solution in the market by a long shot. But, if it was, there wouldn&amp;#39;t be so many alternatives building on their inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my take is to use WordPress if you want to learn how to create websites, enjoy lots of customizations, and money isn&amp;#39;t a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the blogger world, pick a better and less frustrating alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

My basic idea was to repost the articles I write on my blog on to various subreddits with some edits to make them more suitable for the subreddit on question.

461,,Blogging,"Hey everyone,

I'm new to this subject (and subreddit) and didn't find an answer for this in my search. I apologize if I missed something and am posting a duplicate question. 

I am planning to start a website for a visual design portfolio and blog. A large part of what I'd like to share in the blog aren't just things related to the portfolio projects but also other things I'm learning, reading, find interesting and want to share, etc. But part of that might sometimes include things that might be NSFW/Adult, topics such as relationships, sexuality, BDSM, etc. I don't mean porn or even erotic art necessarily, more likely text, but should I still separate posts on that topic into another blog?

My concerns with having them in the same blog are not so much worry about people knowing I'm interested in learning/reading/sharing about these things, but I don't know if having them on the same site where you post professional work is considered a big no-no or tactless or something.

My concerns with having them separate is that I see the blog as being very long term (whereas I may switch careers down the road) and I think I'd like to have all of my blogging content together for simplicity and organization.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of having them together (on the same website)? What are the advantages and disadvantages of having them separate? Is there a simpler way to deal with it? Am I overthinking this and should just post it all in the same blog and not worry about it?

&lt;p&gt;My concerns with having them in the same blog are not so much worry about people knowing I&amp;#39;m interested in learning/reading/sharing about these things, but I don&amp;#39;t know if having them on the same site where you post professional work is considered a big no-no or tactless or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My concerns with having them separate is that I see the blog as being very long term (whereas I may switch careers down the road) and I think I&amp;#39;d like to have all of my blogging content together for simplicity and organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the advantages and disadvantages of having them together (on the same website)? What are the advantages and disadvantages of having them separate? Is there a simpler way to deal with it? Am I overthinking this and should just post it all in the same blog and not worry about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any feedback you can give!&lt;/p&gt;

Thought I'd share what I have accomplished as I'm thrilled with where I'm at!

I initially started with the thought I would get no page views until the 6-12 month mark, but straight from the get go I was able to get 1-5 views only after the first few days of releasing my blog.

I'm now in my 4th month and no way I could have imagined getting 20-40 viewers a day. I now hit my biggest day at 69 page views :D just over-thrilled with the progress and wanted to share as I don't have anyone else to tell.

* One or two first page google search results for certain keyphrases
* Niche: IT Tutorial/Troubleshooting guides
* I've seen random months where Microsoft Teams or some university has a ton of traffic to my site - meaning people *are* finding value in my content.

Link to stats screenshots: [https://imgur.com/a/z4HCIyi](https://imgur.com/a/z4HCIyi). Looking at prior months, I've gotten CLOSE to 1k Unique visitors per month.  Seems like my average will be between 700-900 though?

I started a tech tutorial/guides/troubleshooting website last year.  I was using only free tools for SEO research and made a few articles using just the free tools.  One cornerstone piece still gets a decent amount of traffic, but took a week to write.  I've also started a YouTube with videos that correspond to my articles.  My articles took a while to write, typically between 4-10 hours (one cornerstone piece took probably 30). They took so long I think because I was trying to do this for every one:

* Have 1000-3000 words
* MANY images with alt-tags, captions, etc, 
* Many outbound and internal links
* Targeting 2-4 keyphrases per article, with 4-6 'related' keyphrases
* Identify a 'target' competitor's page, and try to inch them out for one or two phrases.

I haven't produced a new article in about 9 months, but just before I stopped, I got a free trial of Moz Pro.  WOW does that ever save time.  I trusted their stats blindly and saved hours per article of additional keyword research, competitor analysis, etc.  I wrote two articles, neither using my previous strategies, just info based on the keyphrases and keywords provided by Moz, and yet those two articles now account for probably 50% of my total traffic, if not more.  

So, assuming the following:

1. My current traffic stats, I think they are not horrible, and certainly acceptable for using mostly free tools.
2. If I started writing again, I would pay for Moz Pro, and would be able to write articles much more quickly. Maybe, 1 per week?

My questions are:

1. Do you think I can start monetizing now with Google ads?  I'm not sure what amount of traffic is good enough to start earning income.
2. 2) Do you think the amount of traffic I have thusfar, using mostly free tools, and the amount of traffic I've seen using a paid tool, encourage my continued efforts on the site?  Assuming 1 article per week is sustainable, in perhaps a year I may be around the 2-5k visitors/mo?

What are the other qualifiers that you would use to determine if it’s a good keyword?

Serp 2: Are X made of Y? - Forbes

Serp 5: X- Wikipedia 

So on and so forth, other returns below it seem to address the question in as well, at least in some capacity.

My instincts tell me that this is not a good keyword, but I don’t understand how quora shows up so frequently like this surrounded by other high profile websites.

503,,Blogging,"Hello everyone,

I just started my website about a month ago and I have 12 posts so far with more on the way. I’ve been writing everything myself so far because my niche is somewhat technical.

There is a competitor site that has a moz DA of about 35 (if that matters) and I noticed that his page views seem to have shot up recently.

I combed through the blog and found some really juicy keywords in there, some in the 2500/mo volumes. 

All of these keywords look underserved and have quora results on the top page. Basically this guy has done some good keyword research.

Other than possibly being unethical, is there any reason I shouldn’t target these same keywords and write my own articles on them?

I’m wondering if this could draw attention to my site in a way that I don’t want, and possibly have this process reversed on me by the other party.

Any thoughts or feedback would be much appreciated.

I don't think this falls under topic #5 (Blogging or marketing strategy idea feedback.) on the FAQ post, so mods please let me know if this belongs elsewhere, or there's a better subreddit for this.
   
So a bit of backstory...I'm an internal medicine physician with a really good salary and a doctor wife, and our plan is to be 100% financially independent after about 10-12 years of clinical practice, or sooner if I can get a good amount of non-clinical revenue (e.g. a blog). We're pretty frugal and are very money savvy so I don't think this will be super difficult. My goal is to live in different countries around the world so remote work or things such as blogging are ideal for me...plus I love being at home or in a café. I love to write, start discussions, and share my thoughts. I think I have a really interesting and easy-to-understand perspective on the things I want to write about (I guess everyone does though, right?), though I'm dumb as shit about many other things. 
   
**My Reasons for Starting a Blog:**    

- It will be fun, I like writing, I like sharing my thoughts, and writing it down helps me organize my thoughts better for my own benefit    

- My wife is an excellent cook and gardener, and she would have a lot of fun making posts, garden plans and cooking videos   

- I like remote work and I want to monetize it so I still get SOME income, but I don't realistically need to make much money with it   

- I don't want my kids to grow up with me not ""working"" at all, so if nothing else having a blog or something to generate revenue (I can always lie and say it makes more than it does if need be) still lets me maintain in their eyes that I am working, I'm just not going to a ""paid employment"" position
    
**Ideas for the Blog:**   

- My initial goal was to cover 1) financial literacy (for physicians), 2) general ""efficiency""/life hacks/self-improvement, and 3) miscellaneous.      

1. Since I don't want to talk TOO MUCH about financial literacy I think it would be better to maybe just talk about financial literacy in general, with a bit more content geared toward physicians/high income earners. I'm also a huge fan of other physician finance blogs (e.g. White Coat Investor) so I don't want that to be my MAIN thing.   
      
2. I'm very efficient (I'm an INTJ if that matters) and I love books like ""Atomic Habits,"" ""Deep Work,"" ""Personal Kanban Method,"" as well as certain philosophy/psychology books so I'd love to talk about these. Whenever I read non-fiction books I take a lot of notes so I already have ""book summaries"" written on many books, so this would make initial content creation pretty easy. This and finances were originally going to be about 75-80% of the blog, though at a certain point I get bored about talking about finances so I'm wondering if I should rethink this.       

3. I'm a huge fan of learning languages (I'm fluent in French, learning Mandarin, conversational in Spanish) and my wife is fluent in English and Mandarin and learning French. I think I have a useful perspective on learning languages so this would be a decent amount of content on the site as well. I think people are really missing theories and basics on how to learn languages, rather than the language content itself, so I could definitely help with this            

4. I love my kids and spend a lot of time raising them with my wife, so I'd like to blog a bit about family, as well as books related to raising kids.      

5. We like to travel a lot, so I think my wife (or I) would want to write about this a bit as well       

6. I want to write small amounts on personal health in general as it's important. I exercise a ton and eat pretty healthily. I'll have to tread carefully on this since I'm a physician and I cannot give personalized health advice   
        

**How I Envision Making Money:**   

- Links to Amazon books. All my book reviews or just books I mention will link to a paid Amazon link. No extra expense to the reader but I get kickback          

- If my wife loves the cooking videos/blogging, we'd consider doing like a 6-week Chinese cooking course or something fun like that      

- Referrals to outside partners. I know a few very good CFAs and disability insurance people who I would be comfortable referring readers to. I would not just refer to any random person who is willing to give me some kickback       

- Ads?? Not sure        
   
- Affiliate partnerships? I love sites/podcasts like ChooseFI and would love to get involved with them.  

- I will NOT sell any medical supplements, medical products, herbs, etc. I think that's super sketchy for a physician to do    

     
**My Goals with This Blog:**        

- Still be able to maintain with my kids that I ""work"" and bring in money through this active process. I'm okay if they know I worked my ass off when they were young to invest lots of money and live off the investments, but I don't want them getting spoiled or having a warped view of hard work if I literally never ""work"" again after they're 7-10 years old.         

- Writing this would be a lot of fun for me       

- Having income aside from investments still just feels good, even if I don't need it really. My ultimate goal (okay if it takes 2-5 years) would be to make $15-50k per year from the blog. I don't think I'd ever put in enough work to make more than that     

- It just sounds fun for me          

- As for my wife, I think this would be a super fun and creative outlet for her. She doesn't want to ""work"" anymore after about 5 more years, as she would prefer to mostly stay at home, but I think her contributions (cooking, gardening, etc.) would be very fulfilling for her and still give her the sense of making money, though being a stay-at-home parent is a job in and of itself so I'd be fine if she did 0% extra.   
   
**My Concerns:**      

- Do I have a target audience? If I can find physicians that want to learn more about finance but also are interested in learning about foreign languages, traveling, cooking, and being more efficient in life, then awesome! But I fear that my scope is too broad or non-specific.      

- Are these topics just overdone?      

- Is there a better way to have fun with these things and still make money from them for the sake of ""working""? I don't want to run a podcast myself necessarily but maybe that's a better option? I don't want to write a book on any of these topics. I am considering writing a book for patients about how to engage with the medical world and take care of your health in general, as I think it's sorely lacking and I'm very good at explaining things to patients in simple terms...but I don't want my blog to be a personal health or anything else blog.  
   

So I'm interested but I just don't want to do all this if there's very little point or if I need to do a lot more thinking. I know the best way to get started is to just get started, but naturally I'm still hesitant to devote a lot of time to this if I have no target audience or my scope is too random/broad. I'm not worried about any startup costs (e.g. Wordpress domain, paying someone to design the site) as I'm very fortunate to have a high-paying job and I can just work a few extra shifts. Time is my most limited resource so I'm most worried about wasting a lot of that.

This and finances were originally going to be about 75-80% of the blog, though at a certain point I get bored about talking about finances so I&amp;#39;m wondering if I should rethink this.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of learning languages (I&amp;#39;m fluent in French, learning Mandarin, conversational in Spanish) and my wife is fluent in English and Mandarin and learning French. I think I have a useful perspective on learning languages so this would be a decent amount of content on the site as well. I think people are really missing theories and basics on how to learn languages, rather than the language content itself, so I could definitely help with this            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love my kids and spend a lot of time raising them with my wife, so I&amp;#39;d like to blog a bit about family, as well as books related to raising kids.      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We like to travel a lot, so I think my wife (or I) would want to write about this a bit as well       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to write small amounts on personal health in general as it&amp;#39;s important. I exercise a ton and eat pretty healthily. I&amp;#39;ll have to tread carefully on this since I&amp;#39;m a physician and I cannot give personalized health advice   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I Envision Making Money:&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links to Amazon books. All my book reviews or just books I mention will link to a paid Amazon link. No extra expense to the reader but I get kickback          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If my wife loves the cooking videos/blogging, we&amp;#39;d consider doing like a 6-week Chinese cooking course or something fun like that      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referrals to outside partners. I know a few very good CFAs and disability insurance people who I would be comfortable referring readers to. I would not just refer to any random person who is willing to give me some kickback       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ads?? Not sure        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affiliate partnerships? I love sites/podcasts like ChooseFI and would love to get involved with them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will NOT sell any medical supplements, medical products, herbs, etc. I think that&amp;#39;s super sketchy for a physician to do    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Goals with This Blog:&lt;/strong&gt;        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still be able to maintain with my kids that I &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; and bring in money through this active process. I&amp;#39;m okay if they know I worked my ass off when they were young to invest lots of money and live off the investments, but I don&amp;#39;t want them getting spoiled or having a warped view of hard work if I literally never &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; again after they&amp;#39;re 7-10 years old.         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing this would be a lot of fun for me       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having income aside from investments still just feels good, even if I don&amp;#39;t need it really. My ultimate goal (okay if it takes 2-5 years) would be to make $15-50k per year from the blog. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d ever put in enough work to make more than that     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It just sounds fun for me          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for my wife, I think this would be a super fun and creative outlet for her. She doesn&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; anymore after about 5 more years, as she would prefer to mostly stay at home, but I think her contributions (cooking, gardening, etc.) would be very fulfilling for her and still give her the sense of making money, though being a stay-at-home parent is a job in and of itself so I&amp;#39;d be fine if she did 0% extra.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Concerns:&lt;/strong&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I have a target audience? If I can find physicians that want to learn more about finance but also are interested in learning about foreign languages, traveling, cooking, and being more efficient in life, then awesome! But I fear that my scope is too broad or non-specific.      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are these topics just overdone?      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a better way to have fun with these things and still make money from them for the sake of &amp;quot;working&amp;quot;? I don&amp;#39;t want to run a podcast myself necessarily but maybe that&amp;#39;s a better option? I don&amp;#39;t want to write a book on any of these topics. I am considering writing a book for patients about how to engage with the medical world and take care of your health in general, as I think it&amp;#39;s sorely lacking and I&amp;#39;m very good at explaining things to patients in simple terms...but I don&amp;#39;t want my blog to be a personal health or anything else blog.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m interested but I just don&amp;#39;t want to do all this if there&amp;#39;s very little point or if I need to do a lot more thinking. I know the best way to get started is to just get started, but naturally I&amp;#39;m still hesitant to devote a lot of time to this if I have no target audience or my scope is too random/broad. I&amp;#39;m not worried about any startup costs (e.g. Wordpress domain, paying someone to design the site) as I&amp;#39;m very fortunate to have a high-paying job and I can just work a few extra shifts. Time is my most limited resource so I&amp;#39;m most worried about wasting a lot of that.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;
