* Genre
* Word count
* Type of feedback desired (line-by-line edits, general impression, etc.)

Anyone who wants to critique the story should respond to the original writing comment. The post is set to contest mode, so the stories will appear in a random order, and child comments will only be seen by people who want to check them.

This post will be active for approximately one week.

For anyone using Google Drive for critique: Drive is one of the easiest ways to share and comment on work, but keep in mind all activity is tied to your Google account and may reveal personal information such as your full name. If you plan to use Google Drive as your critique platform, consider creating a separate account solely for sharing writing that does not have any connections to your real-life identity.

Be reasonable with expectations. Posting a short chapter or a quick excerpt will get you many more responses than posting a full work. Everyone's stamina varies, but generally speaking the more you keep it under 5,000 words the better off you'll be.

2,,writing,"Over the past several days I have seen many questions here about “what can you do with language” which wouldn’t be the case if the questionmaker read more poetry.

I’ve also noticed that many here are drawn to the genre of fantasy, a kind of writing that draws heavily on description. How can you describe things without falling into the old-age clichés? Poetry.

While the goal of a novel (or a trilogy, or a series of series of 150 books) is to ultimately tell a story, the goal of poetry is often to use language to offer a feeling. Which feeling depends on the reader, since most poetry only do half of the work and require the reader to do the other half. This is by design.

In short, there’s something you can do quickly and cheaply to enhance your writing: read more poetry, and reflect upon what you’re reading. Your mastery of language will get better, your skills at lyric analogy will get better, even your life might get a little better if you find a poem that speaks deeply to you. I know I have a couple.

After reading the rules, I think asking for this kind of participation is allowed, and I apologise if it's not.

In 2016 I quit my job to go to the Philippines for 1 year and film insects in the jungles. My project is to make a film where all the ""characters"" are insects. Not like a documentary, more like a film. So no voice over explaining everything, but a lot of cool insect close ups mixed with sound design to bring us closer to the scale of that world.

After almost 7 years of on and off working on it, I am planning to finish it this year.

I have written an intro/outro for the film, which will be read, but after re-writing it dozens of times, I'm still really not satisfied with the style or how things are said. I'm really not a writer.

The main goal of the film is to spark curiosity for this invisible world, and for nature in general. There is a notion of cultivating our appreciation for the small things, in order to be happier, that I would like to express, but I can't find how.

What I can offer for your help is your credit in the film, because this is not a paid project for myself, I'm just making it so it will exist, and it will be ""offered"" to the world for free. You would have to allow me to use what you write in the film, to be recorded as voice over, and distribute it openly.

I will post what I wrote bellow. If anyone feels inspired to either re-write it, or even just improve certain parts of it, I will be very grateful. 

Merci :)

**INTRO**

Pay attention. Attention is vitality. It connects you with others. It makes you curious. Curiosity is one of the great secrets of happiness.

On this Christmas Eve, my brother and I are leaving France for the Philippines. What I have in mind is to make a film focusing on the smallest creatures we can find.  All I’m bringing is a small camera and some basic equipment.

This is a contemplative journey. You are free to interpret what you see in your own way. I hope that I can spark some curiosity in you, and maybe deepen your perspective for this hidden world living everywhere among us.

&amp;#x200B;

**OUTRO**

In the month following the filming, Taal Volcano erupted. Clouds of ashes were projected into the sky for days, and a thick layer covered the forests, putting 40 years of thriving life since the last eruption, on pause again.

28,,writing,"So. I've ""recently"" decided to admit and do something about this huge issue with my story: the main character is super boring.

As I developed the rest of the characters, traits were swapped out and other compelling storylines showed up which left him both boring and goal-less. He's always a passive character (and that's fine because my pure evil villain is fueled by curiosity and human experimentation, so she almost always has the upper hand), but he's got no goals of his own.

Now I'm trying to stick other characters into his seat to see if something works, but it doesn't quite feel right. I'm not sure whether that's because he's an irredeemable Mary Sue and I need to start from scratch, or because you can't just put a triangle in a cube shaped box, no matter how many shonen anime power ups you can muster, without breaking the triangle or the damned box. And then what's even the point?

BUT! That also led me to a second situation: lack of examples.

As I thought about characters to fit into my fallen hero with a corruption arc to test out the previous ""theory"", I realized his eventual return to team good guy was too based off of Zuko's redemption. Which, to be honest, is the only issue I can find with it. It's so damn good, I rarely ever see/ can't think of any examples of other perfectly executed redemption arcs to study and/or reference.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;I personally like writing for visual and interactive mediums. So games, comics, and TV. As a result, when I do write prose, it tends to be lacking in description. I tend to love writing dialogue, as a result. I weirdly enjoy writing short stories and hate the movie format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like writing dramas, especially family ones. I&amp;#39;m awful at comedy, though, and would like to get better at that. And for some reason, never really got that into fantasy but I like writing America fantastica style. I love interweaving fantasy into a modern day setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve actually checked books out of the local library from the middle-grade children&amp;#39;s section, to research how actual children&amp;#39;s literature is structured and written.  But I still can&amp;#39;t shake the feeling that I&amp;#39;m missing something simple and important which leaves my story lacking.  I&amp;#39;ve got a good story and am working on it with the goal of actual publication, hopefully sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;

58,,writing,"Hey guys!

Last year, I picked up writing as a hobby to do something useful with all the thoughts I have about the world we live in. So far, I have mostly been writing about my vision on politics and interesting science stuff I learned.

While I write mostly for my own sanity to put my thoughts on paper, I do share my writings with friends and would like to publish them in some form in the future. (in the near future; probably Medium or other blog sites)

What I struggle with however, is citations and references. Many things I write about, I first put down all the thoughts I have based on all the news articles and books I have read over the years and then later dive in deeper into the things I wrote to like.. Fact check myself and find reputable sources that back up my vision, or, if I am wrong, I correct myself and add details I found while researching my own claims.

So far, pretty easy. I add a lot of footnotes to articles of reputable sources that back up my claims and add footnotes for the new things I didn't know about yet.

There are two issues I am facing however: Often these sources are not the original sources I once formed my opinion based upon. After all, casually reading the news every day and reading books, doesn't involve constantly writing down what you read and where. Is that a problem when it comes to plagiarism? I mean, often different experts in different books or newspapers come to the same conclusion.

Another thing is being inspired by essays of other people. Not only do they provide the opinion of someone else, they also often have a list of sources they used I can dive into. But how should one do it footnotes in this case? If I read their sources and come to the same conclusion, should I cite the essay, or the sources the essay is based upon? And would it, if I'd only cite the original sources, be a good thing to add an acknowledgements or further reading heading at the end of my blog post and then list videos and essays that I didn't refer to directly in my footnotes, but provided a starting point when it comes to researching a topic, or provided a look into how others formed their opinion?

I think the main reason why I am struggling with citations is that my writing style consists of a lot of paraphrasing things I remember reading but don't remember the source of as well as paraphrasing research I found that I do know the source of. All of this I do to combine a lot of single events and articles into an overarching narrative of my worldview if that makes sense.

All of this I do to combine a lot of single events and articles into an overarching narrative of my worldview if that makes sense.
A bit like how Wikipedia articles are written but less objective and more opinionated.&lt;/p&gt;

If you're going to give your main character(s) a victory, show how and why they achieved it, like an actual logical reason, not just cause they're the Mc.

It's really annoying when characters get away with things just because they're the main. Like, regular people have flaws, and struggles and they're not going to succeed in *everything* they do. 

If you want to write a good main character remember that they're not *actually* the mc they're only the Mc in your own head. In the story, they're just a regular person (unless they aren't).

An Mc cannot do whatever they like, they cannot win everytime, they don't have the right to stand up to someone in a higher position than them and talk crap and then have no consequences whatsoever.

Think of it like this, your world is full of people and your main character/s is/are just person/s your story is following. 

Just be realistic in general.

I spend too much time on writing boards like this one because I'm lonely. :) One of the iffy pieces of advice I see writers give each other all the time goes something like this: ""Don't worry about your story being original, ideas are dime a dozen, it's how you handle them,"" etc.

That can lead people to think that a good premise isn't important, when it is.

I can only speak for myself, but most of my rejections aren't because the person's prose writing wasn't good enough. There's a level of competence that has to be there, but honestly, I work with very good editors; even if a draft has problems, we can whip it into shape. It's not a Good Prose Contest where we award book deals to the winners. More than anything else, I reject because I don't think the premise will be easy to sell (to retailers or to readers).

I pass on lots of things because the idea been done to death *and* I don't see a fresh spin on it. And here are some other reasons why a premise (or very basic plot) might not work for me.

\*there's not enough conflict or high enough stakes to make it interesting

\*the character's motivations are weird or unsympathetic

\*it's a 'that's not how anything works' type of situation (the plot depends on pretending the legal system, the health system, or an industry, etc. works in a completely different way than it actually does)

\*it breaks a cardinal rule of the genre (sorry, but if you're going to categorize a book as a murder mystery, the murder needs to be solved at the end)

and most often...

\*there are lots of threads going in different directions, and they don't connect

Now if you just want to write your stories and you don't care about being published, that's great, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You're spending your life in a much more creative and interesting way than a lot of people are. I mean, for fuck's sake, not everything in this world is for sale.

But if you do want to get published, be picky about the premise you invest a lot of time in. Read 50 or better yet, 100 product descriptions of recent books published in your genre, so you understand how your premise fits in, and how it stands out. If you write genre fiction (fantasy, scifi, mystery, etc.), prioritize high concept ideas that you can sum up in a line or two at the top of a query letter.

Basically I have a last name that sounds like it was picked by an edgy 13 year old. It's real though, I just have French ancestry and in France my last name wouldn't even raise an eyebrow. However, now 300 years later my family lives in another country, we still have the same name and the name is written the same way but pronounced differently. And here I get looooots of raised eyebrows and the occasional: Is that a pseudonym?  No I will not tell you which one because my family is the only one with that name in the entirety of my country. I feel like I don't really have a choice then to pick a pen for several reasons:

1. I am sick and tired of having to explain my last name and I really don't want to deal with comments about how that can't seriously be my real name. I even had people trying to correct me on my own name to something more normal sounding despite various explanations.
2. Again, only family with that name in my country. I really don't want people come up to my family and pester them about me.

But picking a pen name is fricking hard. Despite the annoyance, I like my name. And it feels weirdly pretentious to pick a fancy name for myself despite already having a pretentious-sounding name, as stupid as that may sound.

&lt;p&gt;Basically I have a last name that sounds like it was picked by an edgy 13 year old. It&amp;#39;s real though, I just have French ancestry and in France my last name wouldn&amp;#39;t even raise an eyebrow. However, now 300 years later my family lives in another country, we still have the same name and the name is written the same way but pronounced differently. And here I get looooots of raised eyebrows and the occasional: Is that a pseudonym?  No I will not tell you which one because my family is the only one with that name in the entirety of my country. I feel like I don&amp;#39;t really have a choice then to pick a pen for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am sick and tired of having to explain my last name and I really don&amp;#39;t want to deal with comments about how that can&amp;#39;t seriously be my real name. I even had people trying to correct me on my own name to something more normal sounding despite various explanations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, only family with that name in my country. I really don&amp;#39;t want people come up to my family and pester them about me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

What makes the difference between “good looking badass” and “Mary Sue” is that in the case of the latter it shows that the author is in love with the character.

You can write about a sexy female brilliant assassin, but if you describe how perfect her breasts are and how attractive she is in like every chapter in great detail, and constantly mention how smart she is, that’s a Mary Sue. You don’t even need to explicitly point out those things.. You can use “show and tell” here.

You can make a Sheldon Cooper esque character but with limits.

Take someone big like Dostoevsky for example, he is great and all, but also an absolute chore to read. His style is very plain and tedious, and he is extremely inefficient with words.

I tend to get A grades in my philosophy classes, B grades in other classes, and I have failed (but made up) one class in my four years of studying. I was nominated by a professor to write an article so I can get published in our student undergrad journal. I never thought I was fit to write a professional article but I guess my professor saw potential in me so I took the opportunity. Although i have been mostly a good student in these 4 years (in terms of grades), I have a problem with procrastination as well as alcohol abuse. I have a 5 year history of alcohol abuse, I was in a rehab program for 4 months but left because I think their service was not very good, and I am currently attending therapy sessions every few weeks. I would like to mention that I was raped seven months ago. This month I was diagnosed with PTSD, complex PTSD, major depressive disorder, mild anxiety disorder, and Alcohol Abuse disorder. 

My question is, how do people manage to get their professional work done when they are experiencing such heavy trauma that drain you physically and emotionally? I just want to stop procrastinating and stop feeling like im drowning in my emotions and traumatic memories. My therapy sessions help for a day or two, but i always end up having night terrors about my rapist when i sleep, and they ruin my mood for the rest of the week. I just want to get my school work done well, have my work published, and feel proud. But its hard to do ANYTHING when all i think about everyday is my rapist, my feelings of worthlessness, and my insecurities. And to make it all go away i get drunk 4 days a week. My main goal is to get my work done. I know it is horrible to put my school work before my mental health, but so many of my professors are putting pressure on me and i have to complete this article in a month for publishing.

* Most worthwhile publications will only publish your work if you haven't shown it anywhere else online. This is understandable, if frustrating.  
* Most publications won't accept parallel submissions. This is less understandable, and more frustrating.  
  
Why is this a problem? First, there's no guarantee that your work will be accepted by anyone. Second, you can't show it to the public in the meantime to try build a bit of an organic following, because this would nullify the sacred 'first rights'. Third, you can't group all the submissions together to try get them out the way in one fell swoop, because this would breach the 'no parallel submissions' commandment, which means you have to submit to another publication only after receiving a confirmed rejection from another. And fourth, each submission process can take anywhere between 2 to 10 months, meaning that if you have a few publications you'd like to get into, you have to be prepared to keep your work in a drawer for a solid few years before you publish it on your personal blog or something.

&lt;p&gt;So, for writing, how does this work exactly? What does it mean to learn how to write? How do you become a good writer? What is/was your process to where you are now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks much!&lt;/p&gt;

I hate cliches, but I feel like I’m writing one anyway. My series is planned out to be written over the four years I’m in college- three books in the initial series, plus a prequel. One book a year. It’s a much slower pace compared to the novel-a-month plan I’ve tried, and failed at, three years in a row over high school. 

I do want to be traditionally published, although I’m not going to start actively working on it until I’m finished with college. But I feel like just the bare minimum of my project- “low-fantasy YA trilogy”- is enough to turn agents and publishers away, simply because of how tired the fantasy-YA-trilogy thing is. 

I’ve tried to compress my plot down to two books, but it’s just too big. I’d be rushed. I LOVE this plot and the characters I have. I don’t want to lose it. But I also want to be relatively successful after college, when I try to get these published. It’s not about money for me- it’s about telling a story. And I love the story I’m telling! I want other people to love it, too! 

But it feels like the type of thing a publisher is not going to want to publish. Even though I purposely break a lot of fantasy cliches in the story itself, just the concept of *another* YA fantasy trilogy feels like something that isn’t going to work. 

What do I do here? Do I keep writing and see what happens in four years? Do I try to force the plot into a smaller number of books?

255,,writing,"Hi guys, hoping to get a little bit of advice or pointers from those who’ve made a career out of fictional storytelling — whether you’ve had a book published, worked in a TV/film/game studio writer’s room, were commissioned for comics, etc.

I was diagnosed with both ADHD and Dyspraxia/DCD within the last year (I’m a woman in my mid 20s). While writing is the one thing I’ve been celebrated for/recognised as good at throughout my life, I can’t function in the corporate environments that traditionally employ writers (like media, marketing etc). I’m currently working in journalism, which I thought I could handle as a “writer’s career”, but I’m completely out of my depth and I’m by no means passionate about it. I know I’m lucky to be writing for a living, but I’m not writing in the way that I want to, and with those conditions it’s hard to stay focused and succeed at something I don’t love. I don’t think, work or produce in the same way or at the same pace as neurotypical people, and trying to keep up with them in a fast-paced industry is exhausting. I feel like I’m hanging onto my job by a thread and am somewhere between not caring (because I don’t enjoy it and it’s sucking my soul out anyway) and being in a state of panic (because both financially and generally speaking, nobody wants to face dismissal from a job).

Since learning of my conditions, I understand myself and my struggles a bit better. I want to be able to do something that makes me feel fulfilled, valued and that I’m living up to my potential in the way that I used to when I’d submit a creative writing assignment in school or get feedback from friends on stories I wrote for them. I’ve always dreamed of storytelling for a living, be it for TV, film, games, books or comics. It really doesn’t matter what medium, as long as I get to play a part in developing an engaging story or character. But these industries are difficult to get into for the unconnected — especially as I’m from Ireland where said industries are very small — and I have no idea where to start.

I see so many helpful tips, advice and support offered on here everyday so I just thought it could be a starting point to get some idea of what I and others in my position should be doing/looking into. Really grateful to anyone writing in those industries who takes the time to read this and/or respond 💗

***EDIT: Apologies for not being clearer – I posted this to seek advice on starting points for the likes of networking, looking for representation, whether specific degrees or diplomas help, if self-publishing is a worthwhile endeavour or to see if other ND writers here know of any programmes/resources that help connect ND creatives with industry professionals and/or internships. I highlighted my disorders because they are severely debilitating in everything I’m disinterested in or indifferent about, but allow me to hyper-focus on and dedicate myself to what I’m passionate about. I’m not seeking advice on them as I’m already on the hunt for a less stressful job than the one I’m currently in and am undergoing treatment (including taking ADHD meds).

&lt;p&gt;I see so many helpful tips, advice and support offered on here everyday so I just thought it could be a starting point to get some idea of what I and others in my position should be doing/looking into. Really grateful to anyone writing in those industries who takes the time to read this and/or respond 💗&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***EDIT: Apologies for not being clearer – I posted this to seek advice on starting points for the likes of networking, looking for representation, whether specific degrees or diplomas help, if self-publishing is a worthwhile endeavour or to see if other ND writers here know of any programmes/resources that help connect ND creatives with industry professionals and/or internships. I highlighted my disorders because they are severely debilitating in everything I’m disinterested in or indifferent about, but allow me to hyper-focus on and dedicate myself to what I’m passionate about. I’m not seeking advice on them as I’m already on the hunt for a less stressful job than the one I’m currently in and am undergoing treatment (including taking ADHD meds). So I sorta know where I’m at in terms of what my immediate options are; I’m more so looking for clarity on where I should start for building a long-term plan, if that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

304,,writing,"Do you sometimes start to write, then suddenly lose all motivation? There's an explanation (and a cure) for that.

Like with most behavior, we can say that writing consists of two modes: exploitation and exploration. Exploitation means leaning into your habits as a writer, using old tricks, and relying on what has worked for you in the past. Exploration means diving unto the unknown and experimenting with stuff you're not familiar with. Both modes are useful. Without exploitation, there would be no way for you to remain consistent (and productive). Without exploration, you'd soon grow stale. But navigating these modes isn't always that easy, and there are pitfalls to the failure of balancing the two.

Too little exploration, and there's a high risk of boredom. You disengage because there's no challenge to spitting out prose when there's no real effort involved. You're just going through the motions and it feels pointless. Ennui, and other French emotions, grabs hold of you and you zone out.

Too little exploitation, and you're mostly just wandering around aimlessly. For every little decision there are a thousand branching paths in front of you and you keep choosing them pretty much at random. You are lost. And you don't really know what you are doing. You disengage, because you are not getting anywhere.

The trick is to learn how to make adjustments based on your inner feedback.

When you are boring yourself stiff with your writing, you might want to change things up a little. Visit [a random Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) and incorporate it into your story. Take the styles of two writers you like and mash them up. Limit yourself in various ways. Ask yourself: what could happen that would make it very difficult to proceed with your story? Make that thing happen. Then resolve it.

When you are sick with the dizziness of freedom, do something simple. Find something you are good at, and exploit it for all it's worth. Search your earlier writing for tricks. Use those tricks. Find a story by a writer you like, and transpose it with your own characters and setting. Ask yourself: what is the most predictable course of events given what has happened in my story so far? Identify the most likely resolution, and work towards it. You might even benefit from trying to write a crappy story; it frees you from the burden of self-criticism.

It's all about engagement. That sudden loss of motivation? That's disengagement. You disengage when you leave your personal sweet spot wedged between boredom and anxiety. Routine can be soul-crushing. Novelty can be terrifying. That sweet spot in the middle? That's life, in all its glory.

But I cannot put these things into word as I would like and it bums me out. What would you tell someone like me would be a great way to somehow still make those stories see the light of day? To just keep practicing until one day I might be able to do so? Or do you think there are really good writers with the opposite problem who would be interested to actually work together on something?

They're all primarily rough drafts, but I've already written a number of short stories and a novella revolving around the world and story. I had and have no intention of publishing any of these because they were all just for my enjoyment to work through the idea and get it on paper. However, if I do finish one of them, I wish to publish it just to see any criticism or anything. This is important for later. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is, even after writing out a lot of these ideas and already working through short stories and such, I'm still a bit stuck on this one-story concept. I want to write other stories and ideas that I have in mind, but a lot of the time when I start working towards it, I can lose steam and go back to this other story. Additionally to that, I don't exactly want to fully write out this story yet for two primary reasons: 

1. I don't believe my writing has reached a point where I can communicate this story well enough, and I'd like to get better and more confident in it before attempting it again after the first novella attempt.
2. I'm not sure what format I want to structure the story in. Its entire plotline has a lot of complicated pieces, with events of the past intertwining current events that create what I think could be hard to understand and convoluting in one novel. Because of this, I've felt that it might be better and more interesting for me to illustrate it in a comic or manga format, which I could adapt in more ways as well if I ever was to work on it further. 

I also don't want to write the story, then start working on the other ideas I have in the middle of writing it. I'm just at a bit of a stump here, because I feel like the answer is to just get to writing it and I can always re-write it, but if I do write a finished product that I feel like could be updated, I can't really do that if I've already published it in either a novel, manga, comics, webtoon, etc. sense. Just wanted to see everyone else's take on this or if it's just me if I could do anything different or if I should continue just working on the small stories that I'm trying to work through.

324,,writing,"Hello  👋 Amateur writer here

I know the title may be a bit vague (and confusing), but I'll go ahead in a bit more detail.

So, I'm trying to write up a screenplay of a film, and I haven't really got anything concrete down in terms of progress. I've jotted the general plot down, major characters and motivations, and overall thematics in play here. However, when it comes to writing the 'microplot' and major bulk of the film, my head *keeps* imagining the film I've drawn major inspiration from. I'm aware that most stories draw from their sources of inspiration anyway, but no matter what, every time I envision the scenes, all I can think of are the *exact* moments, beats, and even motivations from the film. Again, I know there's nothing wrong with that per se, but it's kind-of hindered my progress at the moment for getting down just about anything at this point. I feel that perhaps I'm wanting to desperately create something original here, but my subconscious is just referring to the 'inspiration' as the superior version? Should I just take a mental break: let myself refresh without any notice of said work/inspiration? Or perhaps the opposite: revisit said inspiration, and dissect and analyze their work and reevaluate my own. Again, I'm just throwing things out there and only made this post to see if anyone has struggled with the same issue/has any advice to throw in. 

(Btw this screenplay isn't anything professional lol, it's really just for myself. And for context--if needed--the movie in question is Wong Kar Wai's *Chungking Express*)

325,,writing,"So, I’ve seen a bunch of these threads in r/writing recently, and they frustrate me to no end, and I’m gonna get into the weeds of why, but the short version is: relax, that’s a good thing.

To get my credentials down: I’m a publishing industry professional and also a traditionally-published author. I’ve run slush piles everywhere from tiny 2-person magazines to major houses like Allen &amp; Unwin, and I’ve spent my share of time on the other side of the lines as well, scrapping in the trenches to get noticed and get published. I've been doing this for a decade now and I like to think I know my shit.

Right out the gate, an important clarification: “my book is similar to x” is not the same as “my book plagiarised x”. People do submit blatant plagiarism and it’s looked upon extremely poorly, but it doesn’t sound like the OPs of these threads are sending in *The Mournlight Archives* by Brandy Sandyson, it sounds like they’ve been working on an original MS and then suddenly noticed a new title that shares some thematic/aesthetic elements and they’re worried about what that means for their chances of publication.

So here it is: **you don’t have a problem, you have a comp.**

What’s a comp?

If you’ve been in the trenches this’ll be old news, but for the query newbies: a comp(arison title) is a book like your manuscript that you can use to elevator pitch to publishers. You’ll often see it in the format *\[Title\] x \[Title\]* e.g. *This Is How You Lose The Time War x To Be Taught, If Fortunate*. It gets across a lot of information about your manuscript extremely quickly and also links it in with successful titles: “People bought X and Y, they’ll love XY!” Comps are great, and including a solid comp pair in your query tells the reader that you’ve done your homework and know your shit; it tells them you’re a reader (you’d be amazed how few hopeful writers also read, though I’d wager it’s 100% of the ones who succeed) *and* helps them identify the book’s audience. A comp is the opposite of the problem, just chill.

**Okay but what about Artistically?**

Ideas are cheap. If you’ve been writing for any length of time you’ve probably met the dreaded Ideas Guy, who has a super cool Idea for a book and is willing to give you a 50/50 profit split if you write it i.e. do 100% of the actual work. Writing is not about ideas, it is about execution:

1. doing the work
2. *how* you do the work.

If you steal somebody else’s *execution*, that’s plagiarism, because it involves taking their work and representing it as your own. Taking their ideas? Even assuming – worst-case scenario – you did it broadly and intentionally (which really doesn't seem like the case with our concerned redditors but let's hit the extreme end of the spectrum), that still requires you to apply your own craft and create your own product. It's derivative (which is not ideal, you want to put your own flair and passion and voice into the thing, there's a reason comp pairs are comp *pairs,* and we'd ask for more but that would defeat the point of an elevator pitch) but it's still original. It's usually far less extreme than that, it's author x and author y being inspired by the same real-world events and one wrote a little faster than the other, but even in the extreme case it's still your own thing if you did the work of crafting it. I’ve always found one of the more poignant illustrations of ideas vs execution to be Jim Butcher’s *Codex Alera*. Legend has it he was giving a talk on the topic and somebody challenged him and said “okay then, write The Lost Roman 9th Legion but they’ve got Pokemon.”

Then he did it. For six bestselling books.

And it works because (repeat after me) **writing isn’t about having ideas, it’s about what you do with them**.

The problem is, I don't know where to put a flashback without breaking up the pacing. The flashback allows a random character (who has only been hinted at) to pop up as the plot twist of the 3rd act and be rationalised.

The entire thing is written in 1st person and the protagonist only remembers the mystery character when they meet again in the 3rd act. But the flashback is a linchpin to the narrative. So, I plan to write it in a 3rd person omniscient perspective without revealing the name of the characters in it. But, I'm not sure at what point to put it in.

It seems kind of cheap to have it just after they are introduced. Makes them feel like a 'villan of the week' and by extention makes them feel less impactful.

350,,writing,"1. If you believe you suck so much, why don’t you get better by writing and learning along the way?
2. How do you learn? For starters check your own writing. Is there something off you think it can improve? It can’t all be so bad. Some bits have to be keepers. As for the rest that cause you nausea, how do they differ from your favorite authors? What do other people think about them?
3. What? You think everything you write is bad? Not even a single tiny bit is passable? Then make it good by going back to tip #1. Or at least have a positive mindset. Who said your writing has to be good in order for people to like it? Lots of bad books are very popular. Corny, derivative, schlocky nonsense has its audience and it’s big.
4. I said audience, didn’t I? If you think you suck so much, why don’t you check what sells out there? Maybe your mom and your cousin George think they are the spawns of the devil, but what about the others out there? Maybe you are not showing your work to the proper people. Take young adult or light novels for example. Most of them are meh or worse, yet they are doing well. Because they are written for a certain audience that doesn’t include your mom or your cousin George. So keep writing. There is bound to be an audience even for the trashfire you are making.
5. I keep saying you are bad at writing, don’t I? Why should you be bad? Do you by any chance want to be good instead of bad? Then go back to tip #1. Or at least stop worrying so much. A badly written story can be improved. A story that was not written can only be written or go to waste. It’s about persistence, you know? If you don’t persist, it won’t  even be given the chance to be good.
6. You still think you suck despite of all I said so far? Go berserk and write whatever dribble comes to mind without stopping for a moment to think what the hell you are doing. Just do it like in the Nike commercial. Once you are done, look at what you created. It will probably look like the worst thing in human history. But only because it will be unpolished ideas that need to be fleshed out and calibrated. In any case you don’t throw them away. You go back to tip #1.
7. What? You are still here and you still think you suck? What’s wrong with you? You end up being your own worst enemy, you know? You think those abstract paintings that are given a value of hundreds of millions of dollars are actually worth that much? It’s just a bunch of lines that some critics said they cost so much because they felt like it (and wanted to make money). Are you really telling me you can’t draw a couple of lines on a canvas and say it’s worth a million bucks? Others did it. I can do it too. Why can’t you?
8. What’s this crazy talk about placing value on your writing? Who said it needs to have a price tag? It’s your writing, it should be priceless to you. If you don’t value your own creation, why do you expect others to do it for you? Isn’t it an extension of yourself? Your brainchild? Something you made with hard work and is therefore important to you because you made it? Why does it need to be more than that? And if you think it can get even better so others can like it too, there is always tip #1.

354,,writing,"Hi everyone. Sorry, this might be a bit long, but I'm going to summarize the best that I can. 

So, I'm dealing with the aftermath of this situation that occurred nearly 2 months ago. What led up to the events that occurred 2 months ago date all the way back to December 2020. 

You know when you're really into a show, and it compels you to read fanfiction about it? Well, that's what happened. 

I was reading tons of fanfiction on Wattpad, and I eventually came across a story that was pretty popular. I found it really great. It included good elements of surprise and crazy plot twists. It inspired me to create a story that could utilize the element of surprise and crazy plot twists in my own way, taking it to a whole new level. 

By that time it was January 2021, roughly one month after I came across that story. So I began to create and write my own story at a rapid pace. Within a month, I nearly had 30 chapters of the story written (there were 59 in total, this will be relevant later).

At that time, I also contacted the writer of the story I first came across (let's call her writer 1) telling her how amazing I thought her story was. She responded and thanked me, and we got to talking on a different platform. I also told her that she inspired me to start writing my own story as well. Not too long after that, I came into contact with another writer (let's call her writer 2) who also read her story, who also agreed that her story was amazing. I started to read some of her work after she mentioned that she wrote as well. She had a very elegant and complex writing style that I took a liking to. I felt inspired to reflect her writing style in only a couple of my chapters after I read her work. I informed her that I would let her know which specific chapters those were once I posted them (as she was reading my story at the time). However, when that time came, I actually forgot to inform her (life was hectic at that time, so it accidentally slipped my mind, but that happened later on). 

Writer 2 also invited me into a group chat with her and a few other writers who were on Wattpad (including writer 1). I quickly discovered that writers 1 and 2, who I drew inspiration from, along with another writer from the group (let's call her writer 3) were basically besties. By the way, I was the youngest in the group. I'm 22F, and the others were aged 24, 27, 33, 34, and 35. (The ones in their 30s were best friends, aka writers 1, 2, and 3). 

So anyway, time goes on, and I posted a chapter of my story every week. It slowly gained popularity and many people enjoyed it. It was also a mature story that included sensitive topics, and I made sure to make a bolded note of that. I also put a bolded ""trigger warning"" at the beginning of specific chapters that included those sensitive topics. 

I was reading everyone's stories in the group chat, and they read mine as well. Have you ever faced a weirdly coincidental situation where you had already written something, you came up with it with no outside influences, and then all of a sudden you find out another writer has written content that was eerily similar to yours? Well, that's what happened. 

As I mentioned earlier, I had written nearly 30 chapters within a month after I first started writing my story. I updated a new chapter only once a week, so several of my chapters had already been written for several months. And in that time frame, a couple of those writers ended up publishing content that happened to be slightly similar to certain parts of my story. It was subtle enough that it wouldn't raise questions, so I never brought it up to them and it never concerned me. It wasn't often that we willingly shared details of what would be happening in our stories, so I really had no clue of what they had planned in their own stories.

A small voice in the back of my head told me at the time that perhaps I should change those small details in my story so that they wouldn't suddenly think I was copying them later on, but I didn't. I really wish I had, or at least told them what I had planned so they didn't think it was a misunderstanding. 

Anyway, the year passes, and now it's January this year. Writer 3 suddenly messages me out of the blue, which I found very odd because I RARELY spoke to her the entire time I was in the group chat. She more or less indirectly accused me of copying content from writer 1 and writer 2.

I was taken aback and apalled of course, because I obviously hadn't done such a thing. Writer 3 then stated I should properly credit her friends in my story for drawing inspiration from them. I would never intentionally steal any writing ideas from anyone without properly crediting them. I had also already informed writers 1 and 2 that I did indeed draw some inspiration from them, so I assumed them just knowing that alone was enough to satisfy them (it would have been for me anyway). But clearly it wasn't. 

I told writer 3 that I would credit them in the Author's Note of my story, but in a last minute decision I chose not to. Not only was I away on a trip where I couldn't give all of my undivided attention when writer 3 reached out to me, but she was more or less telling me what to do, and that's not how I wanted to do things. I decided I was going to post my chapter on schedule, and then reach out to writers 1 and 2 since they had an issue. By the way, they at that point had not even reached out to me with their concerns. It later turned out that they had been talking behind my back about this matter for at least a couple of months. So I was really shocked, as you could probably imagine. 

Anyway, I received backlash from the 3 after I posted my new chapter. Writers 1 and 2 did apologize for not reaching out themselves about the issue at first, and I addressed all of their concerns, as they clearly had it deadset in their minds that I copied their content without properly crediting them and wanted to be credited. It was out of the blue, as they never demanded it before. In the end, I apologized and did credit them properly, and I thought that was the end of it but it wasn't.

Just last month, I posted another new chapter, with a trigger warning set in place, but it was still upsetting for some readers, and for writer 3 especially. The chapter included losing a child, something she had personally suffered through. I of course felt terrible for upsetting her and the others, and I profusely apologized to everyone I had upset. They mentioned putting ""trigger warning"" wasn't enough of a warning and that I should have been more specific, which I agreed with 100% after much reflection, and updated the warning more specifically and once again apologized for not doing so in the first place and coming off as insensitive. I would NEVER want to intentionally upset my readers, and that is what unfortunately happened. 

The argument then turned to the 3 writers getting involved again, once again claiming that I stole their content when I clearly hadn't. I had also been informed that it was apparently brought to their attention that other readers of theirs believed my content was strangely similar to theirs, which was what led up to this confrontation. 

That really surprised me because in the entire year I had been writing my story, not one person ever came to me about stealing content from other writers. It never once happened. Not until that incident came out of the blue in January.

Then I had been informed that my story was reported, and not long after it was removed. 

However, it was for the sensitive content I included and me not being specific enough about it, not for having copied anyone else's work. I know now for the future that I will be way more specific when it comes to sensitive topics. I also issued a long apology message to all of my readers about what had happened and for upsetting them in any way, as well as explaining why my story was removed. I also gave them a summary of what happened in the rest of the story. 

I also reported writer 3, because her comments turned inappropriate and insulting not only towards me, but other writers as well. I submitted proof when I reported her, but last I checked her account is still up and running. 

But it is what it is now, and I'm taking a long break from writing. It was a learning experience. But it's been really hard to move on because I think about this nearly every day. I was in a group chat with people I really believed I could trust for almost a year, we shared many personal things. But then all that happened out of nowhere. I even apologized to the other writers in the group chat who weren't involved, for burdening them in any way. One of them was kind about it, the other cussed me out (she didn't even have the full story). 

I try not to think about it too much because I'm moving away next week, so my mind has been mostly preoccupied with that, but I still can't help to think back on what happened. I think to myself what I could have done to prevent it, or if I could have changed the outcome by speaking out sooner. 

I also try to remember that not everyone was against me in this. I still had quite a few people who supported me after it all. I also met a close friend through writing on Wattpad, who was also reading my story, and when I told her about what was happening, she told me she never felt my story was similar to any of the other writers in any way. She had also reached out to one of the writers who believed I had stolen from her, and they had a very lengthy conversation. My friend told her she in no way felt that I ever copied their stories, and that the crediting for inspiration part was a bit dumb because no story can ever be 100% original, as all of us writers have to draw a basis from some sort of inspiration. Plus, they hadn't credited anyone in their own stories, other than ""thanks for supporting me, check out her stories"" and whatnot. My friend also reported that one writer for her behavior as well. She's been a huge help and support, I'm so grateful for her.

Anyway, that is basically all that happened. I would just like another perspective on this.

&lt;p&gt;By that time it was January 2021, roughly one month after I came across that story. So I began to create and write my own story at a rapid pace. Within a month, I nearly had 30 chapters of the story written (there were 59 in total, this will be relevant later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time, I also contacted the writer of the story I first came across (let&amp;#39;s call her writer 1) telling her how amazing I thought her story was. She responded and thanked me, and we got to talking on a different platform. I also told her that she inspired me to start writing my own story as well. Not too long after that, I came into contact with another writer (let&amp;#39;s call her writer 2) who also read her story, who also agreed that her story was amazing. I started to read some of her work after she mentioned that she wrote as well. She had a very elegant and complex writing style that I took a liking to. I felt inspired to reflect her writing style in only a couple of my chapters after I read her work. I informed her that I would let her know which specific chapters those were once I posted them (as she was reading my story at the time). However, when that time came, I actually forgot to inform her (life was hectic at that time, so it accidentally slipped my mind, but that happened later on). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writer 2 also invited me into a group chat with her and a few other writers who were on Wattpad (including writer 1). I quickly discovered that writers 1 and 2, who I drew inspiration from, along with another writer from the group (let&amp;#39;s call her writer 3) were basically besties. By the way, I was the youngest in the group. I&amp;#39;m 22F, and the others were aged 24, 27, 33, 34, and 35. (The ones in their 30s were best friends, aka writers 1, 2, and 3). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, time goes on, and I posted a chapter of my story every week. It slowly gained popularity and many people enjoyed it. It was also a mature story that included sensitive topics, and I made sure to make a bolded note of that. I also put a bolded &amp;quot;trigger warning&amp;quot; at the beginning of specific chapters that included those sensitive topics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading everyone&amp;#39;s stories in the group chat, and they read mine as well. Have you ever faced a weirdly coincidental situation where you had already written something, you came up with it with no outside influences, and then all of a sudden you find out another writer has written content that was eerily similar to yours? Well, that&amp;#39;s what happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I had written nearly 30 chapters within a month after I first started writing my story. I updated a new chapter only once a week, so several of my chapters had already been written for several months. And in that time frame, a couple of those writers ended up publishing content that happened to be slightly similar to certain parts of my story. It was subtle enough that it wouldn&amp;#39;t raise questions, so I never brought it up to them and it never concerned me. It wasn&amp;#39;t often that we willingly shared details of what would be happening in our stories, so I really had no clue of what they had planned in their own stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small voice in the back of my head told me at the time that perhaps I should change those small details in my story so that they wouldn&amp;#39;t suddenly think I was copying them later on, but I didn&amp;#39;t. I really wish I had, or at least told them what I had planned so they didn&amp;#39;t think it was a misunderstanding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the year passes, and now it&amp;#39;s January this year. Writer 3 suddenly messages me out of the blue, which I found very odd because I RARELY spoke to her the entire time I was in the group chat. She more or less indirectly accused me of copying content from writer 1 and writer 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was taken aback and apalled of course, because I obviously hadn&amp;#39;t done such a thing. Writer 3 then stated I should properly credit her friends in my story for drawing inspiration from them. I would never intentionally steal any writing ideas from anyone without properly crediting them. I had also already informed writers 1 and 2 that I did indeed draw some inspiration from them, so I assumed them just knowing that alone was enough to satisfy them (it would have been for me anyway). But clearly it wasn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told writer 3 that I would credit them in the Author&amp;#39;s Note of my story, but in a last minute decision I chose not to. Not only was I away on a trip where I couldn&amp;#39;t give all of my undivided attention when writer 3 reached out to me, but she was more or less telling me what to do, and that&amp;#39;s not how I wanted to do things. I decided I was going to post my chapter on schedule, and then reach out to writers 1 and 2 since they had an issue. By the way, they at that point had not even reached out to me with their concerns. It later turned out that they had been talking behind my back about this matter for at least a couple of months. So I was really shocked, as you could probably imagine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I received backlash from the 3 after I posted my new chapter. Writers 1 and 2 did apologize for not reaching out themselves about the issue at first, and I addressed all of their concerns, as they clearly had it deadset in their minds that I copied their content without properly crediting them and wanted to be credited. It was out of the blue, as they never demanded it before. In the end, I apologized and did credit them properly, and I thought that was the end of it but it wasn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last month, I posted another new chapter, with a trigger warning set in place, but it was still upsetting for some readers, and for writer 3 especially. The chapter included losing a child, something she had personally suffered through. I of course felt terrible for upsetting her and the others, and I profusely apologized to everyone I had upset. They mentioned putting &amp;quot;trigger warning&amp;quot; wasn&amp;#39;t enough of a warning and that I should have been more specific, which I agreed with 100% after much reflection, and updated the warning more specifically and once again apologized for not doing so in the first place and coming off as insensitive. I would NEVER want to intentionally upset my readers, and that is what unfortunately happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument then turned to the 3 writers getting involved again, once again claiming that I stole their content when I clearly hadn&amp;#39;t. I had also been informed that it was apparently brought to their attention that other readers of theirs believed my content was strangely similar to theirs, which was what led up to this confrontation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That really surprised me because in the entire year I had been writing my story, not one person ever came to me about stealing content from other writers. It never once happened. Not until that incident came out of the blue in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I had been informed that my story was reported, and not long after it was removed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was for the sensitive content I included and me not being specific enough about it, not for having copied anyone else&amp;#39;s work. I know now for the future that I will be way more specific when it comes to sensitive topics. I also issued a long apology message to all of my readers about what had happened and for upsetting them in any way, as well as explaining why my story was removed. I also gave them a summary of what happened in the rest of the story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also reported writer 3, because her comments turned inappropriate and insulting not only towards me, but other writers as well. I submitted proof when I reported her, but last I checked her account is still up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is what it is now, and I&amp;#39;m taking a long break from writing. It was a learning experience. But it&amp;#39;s been really hard to move on because I think about this nearly every day. I was in a group chat with people I really believed I could trust for almost a year, we shared many personal things. But then all that happened out of nowhere. I even apologized to the other writers in the group chat who weren&amp;#39;t involved, for burdening them in any way. One of them was kind about it, the other cussed me out (she didn&amp;#39;t even have the full story). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try not to think about it too much because I&amp;#39;m moving away next week, so my mind has been mostly preoccupied with that, but I still can&amp;#39;t help to think back on what happened. I think to myself what I could have done to prevent it, or if I could have changed the outcome by speaking out sooner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also try to remember that not everyone was against me in this. I still had quite a few people who supported me after it all. I also met a close friend through writing on Wattpad, who was also reading my story, and when I told her about what was happening, she told me she never felt my story was similar to any of the other writers in any way. She had also reached out to one of the writers who believed I had stolen from her, and they had a very lengthy conversation. My friend told her she in no way felt that I ever copied their stories, and that the crediting for inspiration part was a bit dumb because no story can ever be 100% original, as all of us writers have to draw a basis from some sort of inspiration. Plus, they hadn&amp;#39;t credited anyone in their own stories, other than &amp;quot;thanks for supporting me, check out her stories&amp;quot; and whatnot. My friend also reported that one writer for her behavior as well. She&amp;#39;s been a huge help and support, I&amp;#39;m so grateful for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that is basically all that happened. I would just like another perspective on this. Thanks so much for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

355,,writing,"I will jump straight to the answer. I chose to prologue.

But this choice comes with risk.  Ideally, I want readers to meet my lovable protagonist as early as possible and start emotionally investing in them. But as with most prologues, mine sets up the world and lays out the stakes in a way that the introduction of the hero, in chapter 1, does not. Unfortunately, some readers will not stick around to meet my protagonist and that is a risk I knew going in.

On the bright side, as I am self-publishing this title as an audiobook podcast, I am able to see that 2/3rds of listeners have gone on to listen to chapter 1. I hope I haven't lost that 1/3rd altogether, but if I never get them back, I can't complain when twice as many have stuck around and half of the listeners of the prologue have gotten to chapter 2 and it just released yesterday, so that number will surely go up.

If you are struggling with this dilemma, my heart goes out to you. It is an impossibly hard decision and even still I wonder if I made the right choice, but my prologue feels rather critical to the story, so in a way, there never was a choice.

371,,writing,"Hey everyone, 

I've been lurking on this sub for a while. This is my first post, not sure it's an appropriate one for a newcomer, but I needed to turn to some experienced people for guidance. Hope it's ok! 

I've been writing my first novel and it's been going well so far, output-wise. I have a mentor who is excited about the premise and the writing for some reason and has been very supportive. So all in all, I suppose I couldn't ask for more for the time being.

But today my brain froze. It's not writer's block so much as writer's...nihilism? I'm aware that if I finish the draft and get it edited, I'll want to submit it and if I do, I'll get dozens of rejections because that's how it usually goes. And I don't think I could handle that. I have a pretty successful career in my unrelated field and I'm not used to failure at all. Now I feel like I can't continue writing no matter how much I want to.

Writing used to be extremely fun before I somehow attached the concepts of failure and success to it, it was my passion and a way to unwind. Now I can only picture myself in the future disappointed and depressed so I want to quit in a pretty cowardly fashion and maybe go back to writing strictly for myself.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been lurking on this sub for a while. This is my first post, not sure it&amp;#39;s an appropriate one for a newcomer, but I needed to turn to some experienced people for guidance. Hope it&amp;#39;s ok! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been writing my first novel and it&amp;#39;s been going well so far, output-wise. I have a mentor who is excited about the premise and the writing for some reason and has been very supportive. So all in all, I suppose I couldn&amp;#39;t ask for more for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today my brain froze. It&amp;#39;s not writer&amp;#39;s block so much as writer&amp;#39;s...nihilism? I&amp;#39;m aware that if I finish the draft and get it edited, I&amp;#39;ll want to submit it and if I do, I&amp;#39;ll get dozens of rejections because that&amp;#39;s how it usually goes. And I don&amp;#39;t think I could handle that. I have a pretty successful career in my unrelated field and I&amp;#39;m not used to failure at all. Now I feel like I can&amp;#39;t continue writing no matter how much I want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing used to be extremely fun before I somehow attached the concepts of failure and success to it, it was my passion and a way to unwind. Now I can only picture myself in the future disappointed and depressed so I want to quit in a pretty cowardly fashion and maybe go back to writing strictly for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anybody have advice for this issue? Please excuse potential punctuation mistakes and the like, English is my third language and my mental state isn&amp;#39;t the best right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

373,,writing,"Just wanted to ask what the protocol is for editing interview stories? This is the process we do in work:
For context, this is for our company's social media content to strengthen employer branding.


We interview someone and they answer it via email (3-4 sentences per question). Forgive me if I am writing this way, I am just typing on my phone and english is not my first language.

Then I edit their answers, making sure that it's grammatically correct. Sometimes, I also need to insert more branding related keywords or sentences that are specific to the topic. 

Now my question is, my senior writer often edits my work and most of the time, the output becomes something that is extremely different from the original answer. 

For example, what I do is just 
-check grammatical errors
-fix the order / thought process of the copy
-add keywords or necessary sentences that wasn't mentioned but is required. Like if the content was about ""celebrating valentines day as a single person"", and the person who answered only wrote about experiences as a single person, I need to write a line about valentines day. (is this unethical? 🚩) Normally we would ask the person for more details but this will cause more delays. 

Now the senior editor checks my work but instead of fixing the order or thought process of the entire piece, he writes a new one. Which is not something the person we interviewed answered at all. He uses the answers of course, to get the main idea. But rewrites the entire thing. 
 If I was doing this a little, I think he is doing it to the extreme. And what will be left from the original answer are just 1-2 sentences. 

So I want to know if this process is normal? I am not being sensitive about him touching my work, I just feel uncomfortable that the original answers from the person are not there anymore and it's just his words that remain in the final output.

See, here's the thing. I may have written 5 separate novels (only one I finished, the others I abandoned on their first or second drafts) and a buncha short stories to go but. Pretty much the closest thing I had as an audience for those stories were my only two betas and this dude I sat next to for a whole year.

Now, now, you might be thinking 'if you want to write you have to get used to people reading you stuff!! once you publish a story it isn't completely for you anymore, it's for the public also!!' and lemme tell you, that was also one of the things my brain tried to reason me, and this was supposedly one of those steps.

Keep in mind also was that I was competing against 11 other people, 7 of them which are older and had yeeears worth more of experience. Two of the judges were people who were hardcore writers, one of which entered a national contest--and won that contest.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;The aside from the SF story I wrote the other one I finished I guess would fall under dark fantasy but it&amp;#39;s more eerie magical realism so wasn&amp;#39;t 100% sure if that one should be submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi, so I got a bit of a dilemma which I can hope people can advise.

A year ago, I started writing a story for a dnd campaign. At that time, I did not expect that will start writing a full-blown narrative. In short, I am currently writing a piece of fiction based on the adventures of my players. However, the problem is that I have copied some of the plot ideas from a book.

(i.e. a city with fake gold walls, The protagonist needing to find a dragon egg, etc)

However, everything else is original, including, characters, motives, conflicts, etc.

In that case, I was planning to publish it on some writer's blog or something so I would be able to put it on my uni application. I would not be making any money on this and I will credit the original author for his ideas that I have taken.

This is where my question comes in, how original does a work have to be to label it as an original work, or will I have to label it as fanfiction?

415,,writing,"Just like everyone else, I used to love writing, and reading books, despite my lack of brain power to focus. High school changed everything for me. Don’t even get me started on college. I had a creative writing course that essentially made me jump off a cliff and abandon both activities. 

Well. Characters are in my brain. I can’t shake them, they demand to be written! I had characters in the past like this where I just whipped out a bad short story and they went away. Nope, not these characters. They have a grip on me. They have been basically telling me this story for months, they inhabit my dreams. I wrote a quick short story, threw it away thinking I got them out, nope. I promise by the way I am mentally all here and alright. 

I don’t want to write to be the best, but I also don’t want to suck. I have been trying to read more but I am also so out of touch with what is actually good. I don’t really have time to read a meh book, you know? But my friends don’t read. So sometimes I start reading and get bored, and I abandon books really quickly. Also, I prefer to buy PAPER books so financially I am trying to bring my costs down.

High school changed everything for me. Don’t even get me started on college. I had a creative writing course that essentially made me jump off a cliff and abandon both activities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well. Characters are in my brain. I can’t shake them, they demand to be written! I had characters in the past like this where I just whipped out a bad short story and they went away. Nope, not these characters. They have a grip on me. They have been basically telling me this story for months, they inhabit my dreams. I wrote a quick short story, threw it away thinking I got them out, nope. I promise by the way I am mentally all here and alright. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to write to be the best, but I also don’t want to suck. I have been trying to read more but I am also so out of touch with what is actually good. I don’t really have time to read a meh book, you know? But my friends don’t read. So sometimes I start reading and get bored, and I abandon books really quickly. Also, I prefer to buy PAPER books so financially I am trying to bring my costs down. &lt;/p&gt;

427,,writing,"I started writing when i was in high school. For what it was worth, people loved my writing. 

I never ever brainstormed or wrote drafts. I mainly wrote short stories and poetry. I did start a novella at one point, but I lost interest and abandoned it. 

Writing my first novel is a challenge. I had to have a more elaborate process of turning an idea into a finished product. 

The first step I took was a really long, unorganized brain dump. It was essentially a plot that I would loosely follow, and I didn't focus too much on plot holes. Just the very basic idea. I also created myself a list of characters with brief descriptions of them. 

I shortened that brain dump, and reorganized it into a more contingent summary. While doing so, I got inspired and wrote a few excerpts of a possible draft. 

After the plot outline, and the excerpts I wrote, I'm currently on my first draft and I'm about 20% through the story, and about 18,000 words in. 

The interesting thing to me is how much has been added to the story just by improvising as I go, adding meaningful interactions between characters that adds more depth to their personalities. 

I've learned a lot already, having no prior experience in writing full novels, and quite frankly not reading nearly as much as most people who write. 

Building a world for characters to exist in is difficult. Making these characters have multiple ""dimensions"" (as in not be so bland and basic) is difficult. Making sure the characters have a distinct identity other than JUST the story arc (i don't know if that makes sense) and having them display meaningful character development is hard. The most difficult aspect is expanding on these concepts in a meaningful way. With a 10,000 word blob of text, these weren't things I thought about. 

With an 80-90,000 word fiction novel, it becomes a bigger challenge. I ask myself, how do I expand on the characters and plot in a meaningful, effective way with a good pace?

The other thing I'm worried about is being corny. The novel I'm writing has a romantic subplot and honestly at this point, I feel like with the context of the novel, embracing the blatantly corny nature is inevitable, especially since it's my first ever full length writing. 

Maybe I'm thinking too much and need to just write it all out and go through the process of getting better. 

My biggest intimidation is that when the novel is done and I decide to share, the people who read it will drag it through the ground so much that I won't enjoy it anymore. 

How do I get over myself and just write?",t2_ei4pf509,False,,0,False,how to not be intimidated when writing my first novel?,[],r/writing,False,6,advice,0,,,False,t3_t3w2pc,False,dark,0.6,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1646099330.0,text,6,,,text,self.writing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started writing when i was in high school. For what it was worth, people loved my writing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never ever brainstormed or wrote drafts. I mainly wrote short stories and poetry. I did start a novella at one point, but I lost interest and abandoned it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing my first novel is a challenge. I had to have a more elaborate process of turning an idea into a finished product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step I took was a really long, unorganized brain dump. It was essentially a plot that I would loosely follow, and I didn&amp;#39;t focus too much on plot holes. Just the very basic idea. I also created myself a list of characters with brief descriptions of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shortened that brain dump, and reorganized it into a more contingent summary. While doing so, I got inspired and wrote a few excerpts of a possible draft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the plot outline, and the excerpts I wrote, I&amp;#39;m currently on my first draft and I&amp;#39;m about 20% through the story, and about 18,000 words in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing to me is how much has been added to the story just by improvising as I go, adding meaningful interactions between characters that adds more depth to their personalities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot already, having no prior experience in writing full novels, and quite frankly not reading nearly as much as most people who write. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a world for characters to exist in is difficult. Making these characters have multiple &amp;quot;dimensions&amp;quot; (as in not be so bland and basic) is difficult. Making sure the characters have a distinct identity other than JUST the story arc (i don&amp;#39;t know if that makes sense) and having them display meaningful character development is hard. The most difficult aspect is expanding on these concepts in a meaningful way. With a 10,000 word blob of text, these weren&amp;#39;t things I thought about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an 80-90,000 word fiction novel, it becomes a bigger challenge. I ask myself, how do I expand on the characters and plot in a meaningful, effective way with a good pace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing I&amp;#39;m worried about is being corny. The novel I&amp;#39;m writing has a romantic subplot and honestly at this point, I feel like with the context of the novel, embracing the blatantly corny nature is inevitable, especially since it&amp;#39;s my first ever full length writing. &lt;/p&gt;

Most of my beta readers thought the last half of my book was much stronger than the first and that it was more mature. However this beta reader said it felt “satirical” and I couldn’t be serious with what I was writing about towards the end.

All of my other readers thought my main character was greatly developed- she started as a naive scared girl but developed power over time. However this beta reader thought my main character didn’t change much at all.

A character that everybody else found a bit manipulative and unlikable, they really liked.

A queer character that slowly came to realize about their sexuality was told to be done well by other readers; meanwhile this beta reader couldn’t pick up on the hints and thought it came from out of nowhere.

They also didn’t pick up on certain plot points and thought they were plot holes (but other readers figured it out since it was clear- maybe this reader wasn’t paying attention).

I don’t even know what to do with their in line comments because I’m shocked. Everything other people liked about my book they hated and everything everyone else disliked about my book they liked.

This beta reader felt like such an outlier, but I also want to utilize their comments. What do you think I should do?

Also: How is it possible to have so many beta readers to completely love your story and not have negative comments about it?

433,,writing,"I have been giving this question some thought recently and been coming up blank, so any help would be appreciated. Here is what *I see* as part of the problem with stories that start slow:

**Unless you're an established name, readers aren't necessarily going to ""know"" you'll get to a payoff later.**

I have put books down a few chapters in where it feels like the pacing just isn't there, and I consider myself a generally-patient reader. I shudder to think how many readers some authors will miss out on if it takes their book a while to warm up. As a no-name writer, I feel like I can't take my time getting to the exciting bits and instead am forced to start pretty close to the action. This precludes a lot of potential story ideas. I like to use the Hero's Journey, which starts in a place of comfort, so there are many ideas that feel like would only work with a slow opening couple chapters (I mean you can't properly establish ""comfort"" in a handful of paragraphs, can you?). I fear I will lose my readers before I get that far, so I just don't attempt it. Things like:

#Revenge Plots

A pretty standard and natural revenge plot goes something like:

* Establish the happy life
* Show the betrayal/traumatic event
* MC sets on path of revenge

I keep getting stuck on that first step because it feels like I need to take the time to let readers form an emotion bond both with the characters that will either die or get captured, but they also need to care about the MC before they will feel anything when the betrayal happens. There's this balancing act between wanting to get to the betrayal/trauma so readers don't get bored, but also wanting to take the time to make the readers care about the characters. It makes me feel like this is a formula I just can't make work.

#Adventure/Quest Stories

Similar problem. Do you start already in the middle of the quest? Are we just not able to have characters *decide* to go on quests because getting to the part where they finally decide (and the reader sympathizes with the decision) takes too long? This could even include ""other world"" stories like have gained prominence recently in the form of ""isekai"" (not that I write these types of stories). The gap between starting in the real world before going to the other place seems necessary, yet also seems something of a roadblock to getting started.

# Heist Stories

I personally love heists, but haven't figured out how to make the buildup feel interesting. I have literally written stories that start *in the middle of a heist already in progress* because I can't figure out how to make the planning stage interesting! (and as I write this I am wondering if this is just a ""me"" problem) There are usually one-of-two options you take with the plot structure of a heist, either:

* You provide the plan, which must then fail (but they manage to improvise and overcome), or
* You withhold some crucial information that allows the ""this isn't going to plan"" part to be fixed without pre-supposing the ending

Both options just feel too slow to ever pull off to me. I will write some (I feel) really engrossing establishment scenes that are setting a ton of dominos just where I want them for later, and the interest is just... not there from readers. Agh!

There are other story structures, but that's enough to illustrate my point.

I often find myself reading professionally published novels not really seeing how I could get away with the same things they are. When I'm reading Gaiman, or King, or the big names from history like Dostoevsky (and to a lesser extent, any book that gets recommended by a friend with an ""it gets good"" caveat) I find I am willing to be patient and wait. But if it's some small indie author I've never heard of with no significant following or reviews? I don't have that same trust because I've been burned too many times by books that did *not* get good eventually and instead robbed me of days of my life. So I just... make a judgement call a few chapters in and put it down.

I feel the realistic approach for new writers (and I try to be realistic) is to assume readers will treat your own work in this same way. You can't languish in the setting and character development in the early chapters. Reader's aren't going to wait forever so you have to *show* them that it's exciting/enthralling right away.

The consequence of all this is that some of the ideas that come to me which I feel like writing end up either immediately getting the axe, or get reworked rather dramatically to bring action much closer to the front. (Ex: What I have done with quest stories before is start with the quest already underway and try to work in the backstory slowly, in spurts, through the course of the story. It just feels like a crutch and I'd like other options.)

Am I the only one with this problem? Does anyone have tips on keeping these establishing chapters interesting without resorting to just cutting them entirely? Am I being overly paranoid about readers' willingness to put books down before they get good?

&lt;li&gt;You withhold some crucial information that allows the &amp;quot;this isn&amp;#39;t going to plan&amp;quot; part to be fixed without pre-supposing the ending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both options just feel too slow to ever pull off to me. I will write some (I feel) really engrossing establishment scenes that are setting a ton of dominos just where I want them for later, and the interest is just... not there from readers. Agh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other story structures, but that&amp;#39;s enough to illustrate my point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often find myself reading professionally published novels not really seeing how I could get away with the same things they are. When I&amp;#39;m reading Gaiman, or King, or the big names from history like Dostoevsky (and to a lesser extent, any book that gets recommended by a friend with an &amp;quot;it gets good&amp;quot; caveat) I find I am willing to be patient and wait. But if it&amp;#39;s some small indie author I&amp;#39;ve never heard of with no significant following or reviews? I don&amp;#39;t have that same trust because I&amp;#39;ve been burned too many times by books that did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; get good eventually and instead robbed me of days of my life. So I just... make a judgement call a few chapters in and put it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel the realistic approach for new writers (and I try to be realistic) is to assume readers will treat your own work in this same way. You can&amp;#39;t languish in the setting and character development in the early chapters. Reader&amp;#39;s aren&amp;#39;t going to wait forever so you have to &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; them that it&amp;#39;s exciting/enthralling right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequence of all this is that some of the ideas that come to me which I feel like writing end up either immediately getting the axe, or get reworked rather dramatically to bring action much closer to the front. (Ex: What I have done with quest stories before is start with the quest already underway and try to work in the backstory slowly, in spurts, through the course of the story. It just feels like a crutch and I&amp;#39;d like other options.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one with this problem? Does anyone have tips on keeping these establishing chapters interesting without resorting to just cutting them entirely? Am I being overly paranoid about readers&amp;#39; willingness to put books down before they get good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit- A bit behind on comment responses, didn&amp;#39;t expect to get this many responses..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit2- I literally don&amp;#39;t have the time to write detailed responses to everyone. Thank you all for your helpful insights and sorry if I didn&amp;#39;t have time to respond to your specific comment (I tried to read everything).&lt;/p&gt;

468,,writing,"Hi all,

I started writing a book about 3 years ago and finished it sometime last year. That is including edits and beta readers. First two beta readers loved it, third hated it. She said it was ""not happy enough"". I took her other thoughts more seriously, but obviously, I didn't change the plot to appease her. I should probably mention that the book is a bit of a dark, literary fiction/adventure novel that touches on mental illness. 

Here's the thing. I've been pitching this book to agents for about 4 months now. I wrote a query letter, with the help of a published author on Fiver. I've submitted to roughly 40 agents, and have yet to hear anything aside from a generic response that they send to all rejected applicants. I know that 40 isn't an insane number, but the problem is right now a lot of my free time is going towards finding an agent and doing research. This is time I would much rather spend writing another book or blowing glass/other hobbies.

I'm fairly confident in the book's grammar and everything. I don't think it would take too much more work to self-publish. I can draw/paint alright, and I'm strongly considering doing the cover myself. I know this is a personal choice, but I'd love a bit of insight. At this point, I don't really care if this book makes me any money, so money is not my motivating factor. In fact, if I self-publish, it's very possible that I publish it anonymously without using my actual name, mostly for privacy purposes. That being said, I obviously would love for as many people to read it as possible. Maybe, if it turns into something people really seem to like, I'll market it with more enthusiasm or go the indie route/ have books printed off and then sell them to local shops/ book stores. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? I've never published before, but I love writing and I have so many other books planned that not having time to work on them is killing me.

TLDR: Need a bit of advice from other authors regarding a good way to move forward with the book that I've written.

473,,writing,"Hi! First post here. 

So I've been writing novels for years and lately, I haven't been feeling great about my work. I guess the fact that I'm somewhat aware of what I'm doing wrong is a step in the right direction, but my bad habits are really starting to become a hindrance to my writing process as I intend to take a more professional approach to it, and I'd like to try and fix them. 

The thing is: I'm an extreme overwriter (I'm talking *unfinished drafts of YA fantasy novels that are +100k words without even being at the midpoint* kind of extreme). When I sit down to draft, even if I have a detailed outline, I can't help but make every sentence contain as many words as I can, so I can stack as many (useless) words as I can. It doesn't help that my favorite parts of writing are description and creating a *vibe.* I'm objectively good at it, but sometimes it gets... too much. My scenes end up being extremely long, which results in humongous manuscripts, or in books of average length with very little going on. I also struggle with dialogue because it takes me too long to get to the point of things, so it drags out for pages. 

These stories are a pain in the ass to edit (I'm also leaning towards pantser, so is not like the writing is the time consuming part and then the edits are just cutting words and be done with it) and sometimes to even finish. After years of working on a book that never seems to end, the urge to just quit becomes powerful. I know I'll never be able to pursue writing as a serious career if I don't find a way to improve. I do think I'm a good writer, in the sense that I have an OK prose and some good ideas. I could easily write a beautiful paragraph. I'm pretty sure I'm awful at writing novels, though.

I know the obvious: I should keep writing to get better at writing (trust me, I do. I've been doing it every day for almost ten years, and I'm about to finish the first draft of my 6th novel), but are there any specific tips, writing exercises or strategies that I could go to to try and make this specific problem better? Have any of you ''cured'' your overwriting? If so, how did you do it? Should I embrace it as a first draft annoyance and move on with my life?

494,,writing,"As a teen and undergrad, I was able to write interesting short stories that I still enjoy reading today; it came naturally to me. During that time, I have always dreamed about publishing my own novel, but I never found the right moment to start writing it - mostly due to family issues.

After graduating from school, I made the fateful decision to get into academia and I followed that path up to the PhD level. One thing that I had to get used to in that environment was to publish as much scientific articles as I could. Often, this would mean that I had to pick up research questions that I did not regard as particularly fascinating, but still had to produce a ""publishable"" outcome. In order to be successful, I became part of a toxic productivity culture, which led me to work on evenings and during weekends on articles and book chapters, which were mostly inspired by my supervisor's instructions and funding. Although I am proud of my work and I stand behind the research that I conducted, I believe that, in hindsight, it was too much and too stressful.

I always thought that I'll write my book right after the PhD, so that I could focus on it entirely. And here we are: Roughly three months have passed since my studies ended and my current attempts at writing are, for lack of a better word, lame. A particular issue is that I got used to a 'depersonalized' writing style, avoiding subjectivity, emotions and liveliness. This makes my characters appear either bland or ridiculously stereotypical - among other issues.

Practical question: How I can I detach myself from my previous writing habits and revive my creative writing skills?

Overly dramatic question: Did I actually sacrifice my younger self's talents at the altar of academia and am now condemned to live with the consequences?

Hi! So, I’m here seeking a bit of advice. I’m wondering how to make an existing, established character in my novel more compelling. To give more detail: the issues I have are that this is the main character, I’m pretty far into the story, and lately I’m feeling that, compared to the secondary characters in the cast, that the MC isn’t as interesting overall. I noticed that perhaps I didn’t set him up that well in the beginning of the story, beyond showing some minor flaws, insecurities and conflicts with the other more interesting characters. But now that the novel is getting deeper into the plot, I’m feeling as though the story elements and again, other characters, are overshadowing my MC. He is still very essential to the story, but I’ve had to delve deeper into side characters to have the next events flow well, and this has actually allowed them to pop more than the MC. I keep trying to think of what I can do to make him stand out more, or what I’ll make readers be more invested in him moving forward. I’m not sure if it’s too late to give him more backstory, or if backstory is even necessary because I don’t always think every character needs it to be interesting. I’m honestly so confused, so I’m sorry if this seems weird (and apologies for errors because English isn’t my first language).

No matter how bad, poorly thought out, confusing, experimental, or what have you- do you think there&amp;#39;s someone out there who&amp;#39;d read it and want more, or think &amp;quot;if only more books were written like the Harry Potter fanfiction I read where the author didn&amp;#39;t know what quotation marks were...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about this sometimes, because I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to write things people enjoy, and the internet kind of just scratches that itch, anytime I want. I&amp;#39;ve never cared if it&amp;#39;s a lot of people, or if they throw money at me in appreciation, I just like the satisfaction of people reading my words and then getting some satisfaction themselves, laughing or thinking about some idea that was stuck in my own head.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s when an author makes a statement A, which may have some ambiguity in it, and therefore the following statement in the narrative/text, statement B, serves to clarify the preceding statement, or refute/dispel false understandings of it, but in an indirect and subtle way—without directly coming out and saying “By that I mean so-and-so, rather than such-and-such” For example (I’m just making this up):

**”Lucy was a woman well known in her town, who’s presence had entered the door of every home.”**

**”She was married to her equally renowned and loving husband of twenty years, John, to whom she was always faithful and committed.”**

As you can see, the first statement describes Lucy as a popular person; but it could also vaguely be interpreted to mean that she was somewhat ‘promiscuous’ and “made her away around town.” Therefore, the second statement seeks to clarify that, by specifying that what is meant is that she was well liked and respected, and that she was in fact not promiscuous at all, since she was fully faithful &amp;amp; devoted to her loving husband John.

519,,writing,"Hey Reddit, looking for some advice here.

My problem could be written lots of ways (or perhaps is many problems) but suffice to say I’m looking to make writing my career but feel pulled in many directions as far as what work to make and how to sell it.

My passion is for writing fiction novels. However when I look up how to market and sell them I end up in rabbit holes making content about ‘how to improve your writing’ because that content gets more traction than the content I make for my intended audience. However this leads me to spend all my time starting and stoping working on products for writers since I don’t have anything to actually make money off of aside from potential ads, Patreon, and the like.

Additionally I’m a self improvement junkie and have worked as a counselor for teens for many years. I always think of books to write or courses to make that help others and have a few blog posts that are ranked fist in Google on these topics. I’ve looked into various non-fiction niches and have found a few ‘low saturated’ ones I think I can add to in a meaningful way. However I’m worried I’ll waste my limited time and money getting that book ready for potentially no return. While I’m passionate about these topics it pails in comparison to how excited I am to plot another YA fiction.

Right now I’m working 10-14 hour days five days a week and resent my primary coworker. This leaves me with very little time or energy to use for anything else but a hell of a lot of motivation to be self employed. I’m actively looking for a different full time job but am struggling to find a place where I could make as much money as I am now. I’m paying off an important loan and have very little to invest in my writing/marketing at least for the next six months or so.

I want to write and sell fiction but my ideas for marketing often exceed my budget or eat up all my writing time. I’m unsure of what job I could do while waiting to gain traction in the ‘backlog sells’ sort of way. My research for how to sell more through the Amazon search algorithm is what lead me to trying to write nonfiction- self help style works.

So what do you think is the best path for a writer to jumpstart a writing career? 

Should I write non fiction for a while since it’s easier to market? 

Should I pivot and try to make content and products for writers and potential future readers? This might mean more upfront income which could allow me to leave my job and make time for writing.

Or should I stick with trying to publish my fiction? I have a manuscript that’s nearly ‘finished’ as in I’m querying agents and if that fails I plan to save up for the editing it would require to self publish. But unless I get lucky would mean definitely spending at least another six months at a job I’m burnt out at.

Thanks in advance!",t2_8s9qbxyo,False,,0,False,What do you think is the best way for a writer to start making money?,[],r/writing,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_t1iuld,False,dark,0.75,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1645834848.0,text,6,,,text,self.writing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Reddit, looking for some advice here.&lt;/p&gt;

528,,writing,"Hello everyone,

I have a question that has been bothering me for a long time. My second language is English, and I live in an English-speaking country. My favorite hobbies are writing articles, blogs, and short stories. I simply like writing in general. I've written a couple of English articles, but it's taken me far too long to finish them. Because I'm opening a dictionary -English to English- to get inspired by the word and generate phrases from the word that are cohesive with my article. It's getting exhausting.

I'm about to start writing an article tonight, and I've just realized that writing in my native language and then translating to English is much easier. But I'm scared that if I do that, I'll lose my English skills as well. It's one of the first things I want to ask. ""Do you think writing in my native language and then translating to English will have a negative impact on my English skills?""

I am putting so much effort every day to maximize my English skills and writing in my native language makes me feel extremely guilty. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. Should I continue to learn more vocabulary and only write in English, or should I do both?

I have no problem with speaking English. I can talk for hours without thinking If I'm feeling uplifted. If I am tired, I am struggling.

Okay. To summarize my questions under a single title;

1-Do you think writing in my native language and then translating it to English would have a negative impact on my English skills?

2-Should I keep learning new vocabulary and write just in English, or should I do both translating and studying?

3-Is it possible for me to improve my English by writing in my original language and then translating into English?

What I want to know from everybody is how you feel about stories that start with the ""Newcomer Protagonist"" just learning about the world for the first time with the reader, versus the ""Established Protagonist"" who already has some experience with the world and can narrate their thoughts and drip-feed information to the reader as they go.

Newcomer helps the reader get a natural understanding of the world that doesn't break flow, but it can be more of a ""slow burn"" in regards to getting the story where you're most excited for it to be. Meanwhile, the Established can help get the reader right to the exciting parts without needing a ""coming of age"" prologue, but I feel like the reader can sometimes be thrown in a ""sink or swim"" scenario with either too much or too little information.

Newcomer helps the reader get a natural understanding of the world that doesn&amp;#39;t break flow, but it can be more of a &amp;quot;slow burn&amp;quot; in regards to getting the story where you&amp;#39;re most excited for it to be. Meanwhile, the Established can help get the reader right to the exciting parts without needing a &amp;quot;coming of age&amp;quot; prologue, but I feel like the reader can sometimes be thrown in a &amp;quot;sink or swim&amp;quot; scenario with either too much or too little information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I just wanted to hear other people&amp;#39;s thoughts on the topic! Thank you in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

I don't know if anybody else has this problem, but I think my weakest area as a writer is plot.

I have been studying plot structure to try and overcome this and I really liked Dan Well's explanation of the 7 point plot structure. But even when I come up with all seven points for my story, it just doesn't seem like there's enough there for a whole book.

Warning: rambling

I am terrified to share the stuff I write with anyone at all. I think it stems from my father. Every time I wrote as a child he would tell me how terrible it was and I should give up. He would point out everything that was wrong with it. Even when I showed him things I wrote for school that I ended up getting high marks on he would tell me it was awful. 

It also doesn't help that at the moment I'm doing a uni writing course and if I write what I want (fantasy) I get significantly lower grades than when I write what I don't care much about. I feel like my uni pieces aren't really me, but they get the best grades because most of the teachers don't seem to like fantasy. Or perhaps my fantasy pieces are just worse, I don't know.

I'm so anxious about my writing that I can't even tell my partner the plot for my current novel. Our computers are in the same room and I'm scared that he will look over my shoulder, read what I'm writing and think it's awful. Even though he wouldn't think that and has always been supportive of me. It's obviously in my head but I can't shake it. Every time he gets out of his chair I have to minimise the document and I don't listen to music because then I can't hear him get up. It's really ridiculous and impeding my ability to get any actual writing done.

I always dreamed of being an author but this is extremely unlikely to happen with this anxiety.

Writing this out is cathartic, but I also want some tips as to how to combat it. Other than just telling people about my writing, which I tried tonight and just couldn't.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so anxious about my writing that I can&amp;#39;t even tell my partner the plot for my current novel. Our computers are in the same room and I&amp;#39;m scared that he will look over my shoulder, read what I&amp;#39;m writing and think it&amp;#39;s awful. Even though he wouldn&amp;#39;t think that and has always been supportive of me. It&amp;#39;s obviously in my head but I can&amp;#39;t shake it. Every time he gets out of his chair I have to minimise the document and I don&amp;#39;t listen to music because then I can&amp;#39;t hear him get up. It&amp;#39;s really ridiculous and impeding my ability to get any actual writing done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always dreamed of being an author but this is extremely unlikely to happen with this anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing this out is cathartic, but I also want some tips as to how to combat it. Other than just telling people about my writing, which I tried tonight and just couldn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

599,,writing,"This post is intended for budding/novice/fledgling writers who might feel they're missing something basic. Writing 101. I have read mountains of short stories and book chapters written by inexperienced writers, and I have stumbled upon some patterns. In this post, I'll cover basic stuff like story, plot, tension, and briefly explain what mistakes amateur writers tend to make and how to avoid them.

# Story and Plot

What is story? What is plot? An easy way to distinguish between the two is to say that **plot** is a sequence of meaningful, causally-related events, while **story** is the journey through which we are presented with them. A story can be non-linear, jumping back and forth in time and exploring the perspective of a myriad of different characters, but its plot is rather straightforward: it's the stuff that happens.

New writers often write stories where A happens, then B happens, then C happens, then ... You get the picture.

Matt Stone and Trey Parker, creators of South Park, suggest that all beats of a story should be linked by either ""but"" or ""therefore"". A happens, **therefore** B happens, **but** C happens, **therefore** D happens and so on.

Causality is incredibly important in storytelling. Events in a story are meaningful *because* of their causal relationship to other events. And it's what makes readers *engaged*.

Short story writer and teacher George Saunders argues in *A Swim in a Pond in the Rain* that stories are series of expectation/resolution moments. Imagine a person standing at the edge of a cliff. You might **expect** that he will jump off. Or perhaps he gets pushed. Placing him there builds an expectation in the mind of the reader, and it's your job as a writer to **resolve** the matter. As you might be aware, unless you are David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, doing something simply because it's unexpected is not very satisfying to your audience. You are supposed to *meet* their expectations, not warp them entirely. And that is why causality matters: the rhythm of expectation/resolution in your story makes your readers hungry for what comes next. Readers expect that events will have meaningful consequences. Otherwise, you are just wasting their time.

This doesn't mean you should do *exactly* what readers expect. That would be boring. The trick is to strike the right balance. Too predictable? It's boring. Too surprising? It's frustrating. If you can keep your reader contained within a *Goldilocks zone of anticipation*, you can keep them engaged.

# Tension

According to Kurt Vonnegut, ""Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water."" Characters strive toward goals and they may be brought closer to them or further away from them over the course of the story. Tension grows both when the goal seems to be under threat, and when it appears to be within reach. Vonnegut also advised that a writer should, ""Be a sadist!"" with regards to their characters. Bring them to the edge of their desire, then take it all away in a brutal fashion. If this sounds like foreplay to you, that's exactly right. Both activities culminate with a climax, after all. The build-up, the anticipation; it's all there.

Now, let's look at some common errors related to the sections above.

# Error: Trying to be clever

You want to appear clever. So you do something as a writer with that singular purpose in mind. What happens? Usually, your readers will groan. When you try to be clever there's often only one person left satisfied: you.

# Error: Unresolved expectations

When a writer brings something into their story, readers expect that they will matter. That there's a point to them. If you, as a writer, mention there's a rifle hanging prominently on the wall, your readers will assume that the gun will eventually go off. This is known as Chekhov's gun. If nothing happens and it turns out you didn't really have a reason for describing the gun? You will disappoint your readers. They will feel cheated.

# Error: Meandering story

This falls into the ""A and then B and then C""-spiel I went into earlier. Do the events in your story really matter? Are they causally linked? You came up with a beautiful scene, sure, but is it really relevant to the story you are telling? Or is it just kind of ... there? When you ignore causality, your story will be perceived to be meandering; wandering about with no apparent purpose.

# Error: Skipping the foreplay

If you fail to build anticipation and tension, it will not be satisfying to see your characters achieve their goals. It will feel lackluster and lukewarm and your readers might choose a more skilled ~~lover~~ writer the next time around.

# Bonus: The Thing About Genres

I will close things off with a matter that is very common: writers mixing genres together with no rhyme and no reason. Novice writers might not even be sure what genre their story should belong to. ""It's just a marketing term!"" other hapless and inexperienced writers tell them. But genres do matter. Why? Because **genres consist of sets of highly-specific expectations**. These are ready-made expectations that are in effect before even the first sentence of your story. Readers will expect certain tropes, characters, plots, and if you try hard to be clever and original the most likely result is that you will disappoint and frustrate them. Your story, in its basic form, is a **resolution** to preexisting **genre expectations**.

Here is a basic rule of thumb: readers generally want about 10% of originality. That might strike you as absurd, but it's true. The other 90%? That's stuff they've seen before. They don't want something entirely novel: they want a twist on something familiar. There are, of course, exceptions. But that's what people generally are like. Familiarity is comforting. Novelty is exciting. If it's too novel and original, you leave the Goldilocks zone (and your readers) behind. You might get a cult following, if you're lucky, but you can pretty much forget about having a mainstream appeal.

# Conclusion

And ... that's it. These things are all very basic, but it's often expected that writers will pick up on it through some sort of osmosis. I hope this might prove to be useful in your work and that it might have given you something to think about.

I know this tip won’t be for everyone. I want to share it in case any of you find it useful or maybe haven’t tried it yet. 

I could not come up with anything to write but I knew exactly what the scene looked like in my head. It was like a movie. I knew what everyone said and did and how it sounded. It was very frustrating. 

So I just started writing out dialogue with no action. It was kinda like writing a screenplay. I did this for about half an hour and the ideas started flowing so quickly and naturally. It was amazing. I hit 600 words pretty easily and it was incredibly satisfying.

After I had most of the dialogue finished, I added tags and the rest of the actions, everything that makes a scene feel complete. 

I had 2000 words by the time I wrapped up the scene. 

So yeah. I know this won’t work for everyone but maybe try it out. Of course, if your scene does not involve a lot of dialogue or it’s completely in the character’s head, this probably won’t work.

606,,writing,"I'm writing a novel with four PoV characters, and I'm trying to devote every 4 chapters to one of the four characters. The overall plot is a galactic empire is collapsing, and it follows 4 characters from different walks of life as they react to that reality.

One of these characters is the empress whose next major plot point doesn't really take place until the end, but it does feel like I might be able to use this 'lull in action' for a bit of world and character building.

I realize a common piece of advice is not to write a chapter that doesn't advance the plot. However, some preliminary feedback I've gotten from my first few chapters is that the world needs a little more fleshing out, and at what is likely the halfway point of my novel, I'm only on track to hit about 60k words. I believe Stephen King once said that all writers' first drafts are either 10% too much or 10% too little. Just knowing myself and feedback I've gotten throughout my time writing,  my first draft is always too little, so I thought this might be a good chapter to flesh out things a bit, or work in a bit of a subplot. I had a few ideas:

Add in a romance. This isn't out of nowhere; there's definitely one other character she's fond of, but I haven't committed to pursuing it, but it might be interesting to explore a bit how a matriarchal society produces an heir.

Address fallout from previous chapters. This is what my current outline has me setup for, and there's definitely things that need to happen as...well things aren't going well for her. However, this kind of feels like it'd be dawdling a bit as the reader knows she'd be panicking.

Sew the seeds of espionage for the finale. This is something I've toyed with for a bit and was in my very first outline, but as I've written more, I'm less sure it needs it or makes sense. The empire is crumbling and being evacuated, so there's not really a whole lot of reason for someone to try and take over. It'd be a little like, as Johnny Cash put it, taking an empire of dirt. I could instead move that espionage to take place in this chapter before things are truly boned, but even still, I'm not sure who the right character would be to do so. There's two primary side characters for her, and I'd toyed with the idea of the 'ruthless sketchy' one being the one who saves her from the plot in a bit of a twist. I could just let the ruthless one try the coup, but I kind of like the idea of her instincts being wrong - as they already have been before. The other side of it is two of the other POV characters are either directly trying to gain control or contributing to someone else's attempt, so it might be a little repetitive.

I could just cut the chapter like I said above, but as I mentioned, I worry it's a little bit of a missed opportunity for an interesting side plot and/or world building, and it might propel my novel into an awkward word count straddling the line between novella and novel, and that's something I'd like to avoid.",t2_ba8dp52,False,,0,False,Advice on Where to Take a Story/Character?,[],r/writing,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_szr6gr,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1645648339.0,text,6,,,text,self.writing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing a novel with four PoV characters, and I&amp;#39;m trying to devote every 4 chapters to one of the four characters.

What people mean when they say read books is that is by reading books you see how established authors word things. How they describe settings, pacing, and character development. Reading books, especially the ones that are like the story you're trying to write will help you understand how to write better than random internet people can tell you. 

People also tell you to ""just keep writing, you'll get it,"" and this is true. Writing, even random diddle that makes no sense or is part of your story, can still help you mentally. It gets your mind working and you start trying to figure out the story. Sort of like a jigsaw puzzle, you keep tying all the pieces until you find something that fits and add to it.

All you need is to have an idea for a story and work on it. Asking for help how to word your story won't work because random people on here are not in your head and we don't know your vision or feelings. You have to figure out how to get the story on the paper yourself. Try writing it in first person and write it like a journal entry or if you're talking to a friend. 

Example

 I would describe the last week home before leaving for college as chaos. This year would be my Sophomore year which made it a little easier since I knew what to do and what to expect but still, I was in two minds the entire week. Fortunately, I had Stephanie, my best friend and college roommate to help balance in insanity. We were roommates last semester so it only made sense that we paired up again. A great roommate can make all the difference in school.

&lt;p&gt;What people mean when they say read books is that is by reading books you see how established authors word things. How they describe settings, pacing, and character development. Reading books, especially the ones that are like the story you&amp;#39;re trying to write will help you understand how to write better than random internet people can tell you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People also tell you to &amp;quot;just keep writing, you&amp;#39;ll get it,&amp;quot; and this is true. Writing, even random diddle that makes no sense or is part of your story, can still help you mentally. It gets your mind working and you start trying to figure out the story. Sort of like a jigsaw puzzle, you keep tying all the pieces until you find something that fits and add to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need is to have an idea for a story and work on it. Asking for help how to word your story won&amp;#39;t work because random people on here are not in your head and we don&amp;#39;t know your vision or feelings. You have to figure out how to get the story on the paper yourself. Try writing it in first person and write it like a journal entry or if you&amp;#39;re talking to a friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would describe the last week home before leaving for college as chaos. This year would be my Sophomore year which made it a little easier since I knew what to do and what to expect but still, I was in two minds the entire week. Fortunately, I had Stephanie, my best friend and college roommate to help balance in insanity. We were roommates last semester so it only made sense that we paired up again. A great roommate can make all the difference in school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can change the POV after, the important thing is you get the story on paper and get your creativity flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

ive recently been trying to write into my fantasy story the idea that characters start the story with an ideology, and with time they complete an arc that makes them flip it or change it. i also have a main theme that all the characters's ideologies relate to, instead of having seperate dilemas.

usually with things like this the idea is that different characters have different takes on the main theme, but in my case unfortunately ive fallen into a place where the two main characters and the antagonits are basically the same ideology wise. to elaborate:

at the start they are friends who share the same idea. by the time the story starts, one character has changed her mind. by act 3 a second character which is the main completes her arc and now she agrees with the previous character, which leaves the third, which is the antagonist. the antagonist has just stayed with the initial ideology.

648,,writing," Hello.

I recently recalled an old video (or was it a text) I saw about the writing craft, where people said that when it comes to certain characters, it's okay for them not to change and stay roughly the same. Whoever made the video/wrote the text brought the example of Gandalf who changed physically and power-wise, but morally and character-wise stayed 'as is'.   
It must be stressed that ""Lord of the Rings"" has a lot of characters and hence why I think it's okay to have some of them go through change while others do not. 

Isn't sometimes the purpose of a story to show a character who goes through trials and temptations but doesn't stop being caring and morally just? Or in sadder works, someone who can't learn a lesson no matter what life throws at them? 

I'm bringing this up specifically because I have a characters in a drafts who barely changes. A zealot/fanatic dedicated to her goal. She only starts seriously contemplating alternative points of view/ways to live in the endgame.

I do have characters who, in contrast, change/grow as the story progresses. Most of them start as reactive but gradually become proactive. On the other hand, character who barely changes is proactive and seldom reactive, even though I often use their reactions to certain situations as a plot device for character establishment.

Would be interested in your opinion on how much of a sin it is to have characters with little change/growth.   
I'd like to quickly empathize that this is deliberate on my part, not an attempt to avoid the labour of writing character growth.

649,,writing,"I posted this in a comment in another thread a few days ago, but I figured I'd make it a separate post in case it could help others.

Note: as I'm also a bit of a novice at writing, these tips may not work for someone who's been at it long enough,  but it might help others just starting out:

* **Talk** - act the scene out in your imagination before your pen touches the paper or your finger touches the keyboard. Talk to yourself, make yourself an actor in the scene of a film/show, write it out,  the whole shebang, and write it out *exactly like that* and leave it be. You can do polishing later.

* **Start with the end**- write the endpoint/objective of the conversation (whether it's a sentence or an action),  then start from the beginning. This will help you maintain sight of the conversation's objective without you losing sight and going off tangent.

*  **Space out dialogue with actions** - whether it's a character pacing around the room, throwing their hands in the air in exasperation, an attempted kiss, so on and so forth. If the end point of your dialogue is an action instead of a sentence, have the actions progressively lead towards it.

* **Remember your characters** - in a well-written story, each character has a personality of their own. This should influence the way they convey/say things and react to other actions. Say and do things the way that character would.


 *  **Look up synonyms for ""said""** -It can become monotonous for a reader  if ""said"" is the word used to describe speech over and over again. Words and phrases like shouted, screeched, bellowed, deadpanned, chuckled, choked out, coughed will work wonders if you mix and match 'em up a bit. (Don't overdo it though. For one-off sentences, ""said"" is fine, but for an extended back and forth, definitely diversify.)

From ages 7 to 16, I wrote a lot. I have several dozen short stories and weird skits written up, stored on a flashdrive. I'm 21 now and have written maybe two short works since then. For the past years, I've been addicted to reddit and video games. I haven't been pursuing my talents and my self-esteem has plummted. 

However, I still have a lot of ideas in my head. I truly believe I could make something great if I procured the skills and genuinely put the time into writing the stories I've been hoarding in my skull. I'm not particularly talented, but I have that latent festering urge to write these stories.

I don&amp;#39;t frequent this subreddit, so I don&amp;#39;t know how many others have this fear I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From ages 7 to 16, I wrote a lot. I have several dozen short stories and weird skits written up, stored on a flashdrive. I&amp;#39;m 21 now and have written maybe two short works since then. For the past years, I&amp;#39;ve been addicted to reddit and video games. I haven&amp;#39;t been pursuing my talents and my self-esteem has plummted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I still have a lot of ideas in my head. I truly believe I could make something great if I procured the skills and genuinely put the time into writing the stories I&amp;#39;ve been hoarding in my skull. I&amp;#39;m not particularly talented, but I have that latent festering urge to write these stories. I&amp;#39;m held back by fear - fear that nobody will like them, that they&amp;#39;ll be weak, and that I&amp;#39;ll never improve and my time will be wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to be a good writer, but I&amp;#39;m scared of getting back to it, for reasons I don&amp;#39;t fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been reading pride and prejudice, which has influenced my style of writing (plus I like writing in the verbose style of Victorian novels). I really love it so far, and I feel as though the style of my writing, as it is set in the late 1880/90s, immerses the reader in the Victorian era. If I were to send my novel to a publisher, would they want me to tailor it to a modern audience? And before you write down a very sound suggestion in the comment section, no, I don’t want to self-publish. Whilst it is a very valid option when it comes to writing and publishing, I would prefer  going with a company because it’s…safer, I guess? 

If a publisher will want me to write in a more modern and simplistic style, are there any publishers who are reputable and are known for being a little bit more left-of-centre?

I’ve been reading pride and prejudice, which has influenced my style of writing (plus I like writing in the verbose style of Victorian novels). I really love it so far, and I feel as though the style of my writing, as it is set in the late 1880/90s, immerses the reader in the Victorian era. If I were to send my novel to a publisher, would they want me to tailor it to a modern audience? And before you write down a very sound suggestion in the comment section, no, I don’t want to self-publish. Whilst it is a very valid option when it comes to writing and publishing, I would prefer  going with a company because it’s…safer, I guess? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a publisher will want me to write in a more modern and simplistic style, are there any publishers who are reputable and are known for being a little bit more left-of-centre? Any publishers that publish books which are of my calibre? Thank you for letting me know in advance. I know I’m asking quite a bit, but sometimes, you gotta be a little stubborn!&lt;/p&gt;

685,,writing,"Hello world…

I did not know that writer’s block was a thing, until I decided to write. I learnt it by experience that it is very real. The text cursor keeps blinking on the blank page, teasing our inability to push it forward. 

My main motivation to write undoubtedly were Mr.Nolan’s movies. Not that I’m thinking high of myself, or I want to put it like I thought I could write like him, but at least I wanted to attempt his style of writing even by copying his methods. So, I chose the obvious theme of time-travel, a theme in which Nolan is a grandmaster. I jotted down a lot of ideas, drilled down multiple paradoxes and when I sat down to write the story, blank screen it is. 

So many ideas keep flowing through my mind in the form of short stories, twists, plots and even climaxes. “What if something like this can happen?” “What would people think if the good guy is the actual bad guy?” Blah blah blah. But when it comes to realising all these ideas? Nice white blank page. 

Sometimes, when I read the great authors like Ruskin Bond or a similar great mind, I keep thinking how much talent one must have to convey such simple ideas that we all agree through very relatable characters in such a small number of words?

Writing was neither a passion, nor an interest as a kid to me. I was pulled to this idea of writing only by a godly hint. I want to embrace it now and turn it to my passion. I want to challenge myself and better my life through writing. I know not all succeed in writing, but not all fail either.
